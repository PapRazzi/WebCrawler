</div>
<p>Hello and welcome to MarketWatch’s live blog of Treasury secretary-nominee Jacob &#8220;Jack&#8221; Lew’s confirmation hearing. MarketWatch&#8217;s Rob Schroeder brought you live updates as they happened.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/lew-gets-treasury-nod-for-budget-battle-2013-01-10">Nominated by President Barack Obama</a> on Jan. 10, Lew appeared before the Senate Finance Committee, where he fielded questions including about how he’d oversee the country’s finances; his tenure at Citigroup Inc.; an offshore investment in the Cayman Islands; and how he’ll follow through with implementation of the Dodd-Frank rules on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Lew was most recently Obama’s chief of staff. If confirmed he’ll replace Timothy Geithner.</p>
<p>9:48 am</p>
<p>Before Lew starts, let's take a look at the markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is flat this morning, at just above 14,000. The S&amp;P 500 is up a notch, at 1,522.</p>

<p>9:56 am</p>
<p>Yield on the 10-year Treasury is 2.02% as Lew prepares to testify and field questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>10:02 am</p>
<p>In his <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/shrink-deficit-in-balanced-way-lew-urges-2013-02-13?link=MW_home_latest_news">prepared testimony</a>, Lew urges avoiding the "sequester" -- those automatic budget cuts set to begin on March 1 -- and says the deficit should be shrunk in a balanced way. That word balanced of course will be a punching bag for Republicans since it includes tax increases.</p>

<p>10:06 am</p>
<p>Here's a handy <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg1851.aspx">link</a> to Lew's prepared testimony, courtesy of the Treasury Department.&nbsp;</p>

<p>10:09 am</p>
<p>Of all the budget challenges Washington is facing right now, the so-called sequester is looming nearest. After the cuts kick in on March 1 -- if they kick in -- lawmakers and the White House next have to deal with the expiry in late March of government funding. Without a new budget the government could partially shut down. In his testimony, Lew says that the sequester would impose "self-inflicted wounds" to the recovery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>10:11 am</p>
<p>Sen. Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who chairs the finance panel, gets things going by introducing new members of the committee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>10:13 am</p>
<p>Baucus notes Lew's Wall Street and Washington records and says "there's no doubt that he's experienced."&nbsp;</p>

<p>10:16 am</p>
<p>Baucus is urging preventing the sequester, just like Lew, and just like President Obama did last night in his State of the Union address. Democrats are planning to unveil some ideas about averting it this week. But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said the cuts are likely to go into effect as planned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>10:20 am</p>
<p>Baucus says he expects Lew to be "a partner" for comprehensive tax reform. And he hands off to Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who wastes no time in ripping what he says is Democrats' wish for higher taxes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>10:22 am</p>
<p>Hatch says he wants to know more about Lew beyond his budget experience and makes it clear that he's not comfortable with how the Dodd-Frank rules on Wall Street are playing out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>10:24 am</p>
<p>Hatch raises "currency wars", a nod to the Obama administration's failure to label China a currency manipulator. Treasury oversees a currency report and has the power to label countries manipulators. Hatch says the U.S. needs a "clear policy" on currency.</p>

<p>10:26 am</p>
<p>Sen. Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, will be introducing Lew before he testifies. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>10:33 am</p>
<p>Up next, and giving Lew some bipartisan cred, is former Sen. Pete Domenici, a Republican who represented New Mexico for six terms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>10:38 am</p>
<p>Market news break: Stocks are up Wednesday morning and so are yields on 10-year Treasurys. Read <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-rise-ge-comcast-rally-after-deal-2013-02-13?link=MW_home_latest_news">Market Snapshot</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>10:40 am</p>
<p>Domenici says Lew can find common ground with Republicans. He'll certainly have to work with them so it's worth remembering that he's ruffled GOP feathers in the past. Read: <a href="../../../01/10/six-things-you-didnt-know-about-jack-lew/">Six things you didn't know about Jack Lew.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>10:43 am</p>
<p>Lew now gets to speak. He's sticking to his prepared text. So far there's been a bit of resistance to Lew, from Orrin Hatch, but nothing that rises to the level of a serious threat to his nomination. &nbsp;</p>

<p>10:50 am</p>
<p>Lew statement over, Baucus starts questions with one about comprehensive tax reform. What would you focus on first?&nbsp;</p>

<p>10:53 am</p>
<p>Lew says way to do tax reform is to broaden the base and lower the rates. But "I know how hard it is." Examples of base-broadening? Baucus asks. Lew answers by saying reform must lower rates AND contribute to deficit reduction. Republicans surely getting ready to pounce.&nbsp;</p>

<p>10:56 am</p>
<p>Baucus gets the jump on Republicans by asking about the Cayman Islands investment. Lew said he wasn't aware of the address of the partnership and that he bought into the private equity fund because he thought he'd get a higher return. Says his investment philosophy is typically conservative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>10:58 am</p>
<p>Now it's Hatch's turn, and he goes for Lew's Citigroup experience. Hatch says Lew was tied to liquid and illiquid operations while there. He wants to know if Lew's units helped to handle risky investments like CDOs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>11:02 am</p>
<p>Long list of questions for Lew from Hatch re: Citigroup. Backstory is that the bank took billions in bailout funds during financial crisis, so Hatch wants to know if Lew contributed to risky products. Lew responds that he wasn't in the business of making investment decisions. And that's it for Hatch's time, this time around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>11:07 am</p>
<p>Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, says there's "hypocrisy" between Lew's offshore investments and Obama policy. Remember, this can be seen as Republican payback to Obama, who ripped his 2012 opponent Mitt Romney for similar offshore investments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>11:10 am</p>
<p>Lew's straightforward statement that he didn't help Citi design investments may be enough to let him off the Republican hook at the end of the day. They're skeptical but the skepticism doesn't rise to the level it did for, say, Chuck Hagel, Obama's defense secretary nominee. &nbsp;</p>

<p>11:12 am</p>
<p>Goal of business tax reform is to simplify the system, Lew says -- and plenty of businesses would support that. But he also says that there ought to be preference for manufacturing in the code. That will smack of picking winners and losers to some.&nbsp;</p>

<p>11:18 am</p>
<p>It'd be "challenging" to get the U.S. corporate rate to 25%, Lew says in response to a question from Idaho Republican Mike Crapo. Lew also says corporate reform could be done apart from individual reform but it's not what he wants to do. "Once we're doing tax reform, we should do it right and we should do both."</p>

<p>11:21 am</p>
<p>Indeed, going to 25% would be quite a drop. The U.S. corporate rate is now 35%, the highest in the world. But note that both Lew and Republicans are willing to play ball on this. Goodness knows the corporate pressure is tremendous. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>11:25 am</p>
<p>Interesting. Lew praises Dodd Frank and doesn't say yes or no to a question about whether he'd reimplement the Glass Steagall Act. But he says U.S. must ask: "Are there more actions that are needed?" &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>11:35 am</p>
<p>Sen. Thune getting into entitlements now -- where's the specificity about spending reductions? Lew says there'll be a "difficult discussion" at some point about Medicare reductions. He notes that the president's budget he worked on had $300 billion in savings from that program. That's surely not enough for Republicans, who have painted a bull's eye on entitlements. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>11:35 am</p>
<p>Lew "very much" believes that Dodd Frank rules were necessary, he says in response to a question from New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez.&nbsp;</p>

<p>11:37 am</p>
<p>And now a few words about economic sanctions, which is also in Treasury's bailiwick. Tough talk from Lew on this one, particularly on Iran. He says sanctions are "crushing" Iran's economy, "doing what they need to do."</p>

<p>11:40 am</p>
<p>"I couldn't agree more" for the need for mortgage refinancing, Lew tells Bob Menendez.&nbsp;</p>

<p>11:43 am</p>
<p>Responding to Maryland Democrat Ben Cardin question about business access to capital, Lew says U.S. has to make sure big banks don't create risk to system or to taxpayers. He cites progress on capital access -- but some businesspeople would certainly tell him there needs to be more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>11:47 am</p>
<p>Texas Republican John Cornyn up now with a Medicare-funding warning. This is another area where GOP and Obama can do some work together since Obama's White House <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/medicaid/280401-white-house-adviser-obama-willing-to-cut-medicare-but-not-medicaid">says</a> it's willing to cut the health-care program for the elderly. Lew has echoed that throughout this hearing. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>11:49 am</p>
<p>Lew tells Cornyn that Obama wants to take some tax breaks away from the oil and gas industry. Democrats and the administration have tried and failed to do this before. &nbsp;</p>

<p>11:52 am</p>
<p>Lew says he believes Social Security and Medicare benefits ought to be paid. Remember though that leaves open raising money from providers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>11:56 am</p>
<p>Now up: Rob Portman, Ohio Republican who was on Mitt Romney's short list to be vice president. He says other countries lowering corporate tax rates. Asks if revenue-neutral tax reform that reduces corporate rate is important to economy. Lew says yes. Almost feels like Portman is asking for a stand-alone vote on this issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>12:03 pm</p>
<p>Lew getting pressed by Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown on big banks' borrowing rates versus small banks' and on Chinese currency. He says about the yuan: It is "still undervalued and more progress needs to be made." This issue is a big deal in the Rust Belt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>12:04 pm</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey frames his questioning as if Lew will be confirmed. That doesn't seem in doubt based on this hearing so far.</p>

<p>12:07 pm</p>
<p>I haven't been able to keep my eyes on Lew the whole time so I just noticed those people wearing elf-like hats. Who are they?</p>

<p>12:08 pm</p>
<p>Lew says he won't change U.S. policy that strong dollar is in U.S. interest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>12:12 pm</p>
<p>Strong dollar mention is a good time to check <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/column/currencies">Currencies</a>. Greenback trimmed a loss against the yen Wednesday. &nbsp;</p>

<p>12:18 pm</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Democrat Bob Casey is laying into China for currency manipulation. It's worth noting here that the Obama administration isn't alone in not labeling China a cheater. The Clinton and Bush administrations didn't either. Lew talks up "consequences" for China but says "we work through the international bodies" to insist on currency policies that are market determined.&nbsp;</p>

<p>12:20 pm</p>
<p>Lew is sort of, kind of taking credit for proposing the sequester.&nbsp;</p>

<p>12:22 pm</p>
<p>Republicans are trying to pin the sequester on him. He says it's "so objectionable" that Washington ought to just solve the problem. Markets would agree with that but so far the blame game isn't getting the two sides any closer to a deal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>12:26 pm</p>
<p>Hearing took a foreign policy detour to the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.&nbsp;</p>

<p>12:28 pm</p>
<p>Kansas Republican Pat Roberts slamming proposal to raise taxes on corporate jets. This is another Democratic standby. It's about the "general aviation industry," not fat cats, Roberts says. &nbsp;</p>

<p>12:30 pm</p>
<p>Lew's answer suggests there's a distinction between types of corporate jets. But he doesn't back off from getting more revenue from the industry. &nbsp;</p>

<p>12:33 pm</p>
<p>The sequester can't just be re-arranged, Lew tells Chuck Schumer. Reminder: Those cuts begin March 1, and are $85 billion in 2013 alone, spread across defense and domestic programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>12:38 pm</p>
<p>Lew says he doesn't know the status of terrorism risk insurance but will work with Schumer on it. <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Pages/program.aspx">According to Treasury</a>, the program is good through December 2014. So assuming Lew's confirmed re-authorization could well come up during his tenure. &nbsp;</p>

<p>12:39 pm</p>
<p>Time for a market check. Dow down 43 points and S&amp;P 500 up one point. Pretty quiet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>12:41 pm</p>
<p>Interesting. Lew says he's willing to take out a "sharp pencil" re: Medicaid. Expect Republicans to quote this back to him some day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>12:42 pm</p>
<p>It looks like the elf-hat people are still there. I guess as long as they're not making noise the chair allows them to stay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>12:44 pm</p>
<p>Lew tells Republican Johnny Isakson that it's "very important" to get private capital back into housing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>12:56 pm</p>
<p>Now up, Democrat Bill Nelson of Florida. He asks about European economies and Lew says it's "going to take some time" for them to right themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>12:59 pm</p>
<p>If there's been a market reaction to anything Lew has said, I haven't seen it. Tweet to me if I missed something @mktwrobs. &nbsp;</p>

<p>1:04 pm</p>
<p>Back to Orrin Hatch for questioning. He says "it'll go on a little bit longer."&nbsp;</p>

<p>1:06 pm</p>
<p>"Frankly, I think you've done really well today," Hatch tells Lew. So he's satisfied with all those Citi answers?&nbsp;</p>

<p>1:09 pm</p>
<p>Ah, no, of course: Hatch back to grilling Lew about his pay at Citi.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1:12 pm</p>
<p>Lew says his 2008 compensation from Citi was "comparable" to others in the industry. Hatch doesn't seem displeased enough to make a consequential issue out of this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1:18 pm</p>
<p>Obama's announcement about opening trade talks with Europe was "great," Lew says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1:20 pm</p>
<p>Lew is non-specific about retirement-savings question from Portman, saying there are "things we can do" to make it more attractive to save.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1:26 pm</p>
<p>Lew is done. Thanks for reading along today. And don't forget to follow us @MKTWPolitics, @MKTWeconomics, and myself @mktwrobs.&nbsp;</p>
