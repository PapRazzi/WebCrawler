<dl class="faq">

<dt><a NAME="editor"></a>What does an ODP editor do?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Editors select, evaluate, describe and organize Web sites. They are
responsible for reviewing submissions to their categories, and list sites
according to prescribed editorial guidelines. Editors join the ODP
by applying to edit a category that corresponds to their interests.
Generally, new editors apply to edit in small categories at first, and
then apply to edit additional areas after they have accumulated a number
of edits.</p>

<p>Since this is a community managed project, editors often do a lot of
other things in addition to listing web sites. Many technologically
savvy editors help to build editing tools and features, and share them
with the other editors. Senior editors volunteer to mentor junior
editors. Some editors initiate editing projects to improve the overall
quality of the directory, and to deal with backlogs of unreviewed suggestions.
For ODP editors, they sky's the limit in terms what they can do here.
This makes the ODP a particularly fun and interesting place.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a NAME="how"></a>How do I become an ODP editor?</dt>

<dd>
<p>To become an editor, you need to fill out an application. Go to the category
that interests you, then click on the "become an editor" link at the top.</p>

<p>Your application will be evaluated by one of the community's senior
editors. We receive hundreds of applications, and review each one individually,
so don't worry if it takes several days until you get a response.
Please note that we deny applications from time to time, and no application
is guaranteed acceptance.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a NAME="require"></a>Are there requirements for being an editor?</dt>

<dd>Everyone is welcome to join the ODP. All you need is an interest
or passion and a computer. While there are no specific prerequisites,
we seek people who have a genuine interest in building a directory that
is free of commercial interests and favoritism. Fairness and objectivity
prevail here. Those who still believe the Web should be free and accessible
to all, without bias and unnecessary noise, will most enjoy the ODP experience.
Potential editors should demonstrate a keen eye for spotting quality and
useful sites, attention to detail, and possess good grammar, spelling and
communication skills.</dd>

<dt><a NAME="time"></a>Is there a time commitment for editors?</dt>

<dd>
<p>There is no time requirement. We appreciate any time you can commit to
improving and developing the directory. In order to keep the community
thriving, editor accounts will expire after 4 months of inactivity.
This allows another editor the chance to take over an area where an inactive
editor may have left off.</p>

<p>If your account expires, you can <a href="/docs/en/reinstate.html">request reinstatement</a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a NAME="apply"></a>Can I apply to category that has an editor listed?</dt>

<dd>Yes. Many categories have one or more editors.</dd>

<dt><a NAME="tips"></a>Do you have any tips on filling out the "become and
editor" application?</dt>

<dd>
<p>There is no magic formula for creating the perfect application. Your application
will be reviewed on a number of unique factors relative to the category
in which you applied. In general, applicants should take care to
apply to a small, underdeveloped category at first. Generally, applicants
who apply for too broad of a category are asked to narrow their focus,
and apply for a lower level category.</p>

<p>We view the application as an indication of how you will edit. A thoughtful,
well-written application that is free of hype has a far greater chance
of getting accepted than one that is sloppy, poorly-written, and full of
promotional, subjective language. Finally, be truthful about your
affiliations with any Web sites. Webmasters, site owners, and friends and
relatives of webmasters and site owners are free to join. However,
you should be up front and honest about these affiliations.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a NAME="more"></a>Can I have more than one editor account?</dt>

<dd>No. All editors should have one login and password. Creating multiple logins
is considered abuse, and when discovered, all accounts will be removed.</dd>

<dt><a NAME="compensation"></a>What kind of compensation is available to editors?</dt>

<dd>
<p>The ODP is a non-commercial organization that was established in the spirit
of the Open Source movement, which has developed a long list of successful
software projects created by uncompensated volunteers. The ODP offers the
opportunity for the net-citizens around the world to come together to build
an unbiased directory for other net-citizens to freely share and distribute.
Therefore, editors are not financially compensated.</p>

<p>One of the unique things about the Open Directory is a community of
volunteers who altruistically devote their time and subject expertise to
give back to the rest of the Web community. Editors edit for the
love and fun of it in the spirit of fostering a free and accessible
Web.</p>
