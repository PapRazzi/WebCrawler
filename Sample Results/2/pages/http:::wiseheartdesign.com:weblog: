<p>Here&#8217;s the abstract:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve come a long way since the early days of Rails. And the entire Rails system, while much more robust, can be intimidating and downright frustrating for designers. In this talk we&#8217;ll discuss a couple of different strategies for integrating designers into your team and what you can do to optimize your current designer/developer workflow. We&#8217;ll be discussing a couple of tools that can assist you in this (including John&#8217;s very own <a href="http://get-serve.com">Serve</a> project). Along the way we will be talking a lot about the value of taking a design-first approach to software development and you will walk away with a number of practical approaches that you can apply to your current project even if you aren&#8217;t working with a designer.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="info">by <a href="/about/">John W. Long</a> on July 13, 2011</p>
  <p><a href="/articles/2011/07/13/serve-1-5-delicious-erb-haml-and-sass/"><img src="/page_attachments/0000/0050/serve.png" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been following my <a href="http://twitter.com/johnwlong">Twitter stream</a> at all during the last month, you know that I&#8217;ve been hard at work on a project I like to call, Serve. Serve is an open source project that makes it easy to build websites with <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">ERB</span>, Haml + Sass.</p>
<p>I do a lot of <span class="caps">HTML</span> prototyping for Web applications. I also build a lot of brochure websites for said applications. Serve makes it easy for me to use the tools that I&#8217;ve grown to love while working with Ruby on Rails projects (<span class="caps">ERB</span> + Sass) to construct basic websites.</p>
<p>Serve is modeled a lot on Rails. If you&#8217;re a Rails programmer, you could call it just the Views part of the Rails <acronym title="Model, View, Controller"><span class="caps">MVC</span></acronym>. Serve is built with Rack and Tilt, so it&#8217;s easy to use and deploy on your favorite Ruby platforms. As of 1.5 you can also export your sites as plain <span class="caps">HTML</span> if your Web host doesn&#8217;t support Ruby.</p>
<p>So how&#8217;s it work? Throw your <span class="caps">ERB</span>, Haml, and Sass in a directory, <kbd>cd</kbd> to it on the command prompt, and type:</p>
<pre><code>serve</code></pre>
<p>Then browse over to http://localhost:4000 and view your website there. It&#8217;s that simple.</p>
<p>You can learn more about Serve on it&#8217;s <a href="http://get-serve.com">brand-spanking new website</a>. (Serve&#8217;s new website is actually made with Serve. How meta!)</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s dive into some of my favorite things about 1.5.</p>

  <h2><a href="/articles/2011/04/04/simple-site-search/">Simple Site Search</a></h2>
  <p class="info">by <a href="/about/">John W. Long</a> on April  4, 2011</p>
  <p>I just added simple search to this site for my blog posts with the following code:</p>

<pre class="code html-code"><code>&lt;form action="http://google.com/search" method="get"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;input type="search" name="q" placeholder="Search" results="0" /&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;input type="hidden" name="q" value="site:wiseheartdesign.com" /&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>

<p>This will create a working search input that looks like this:</p>

<form action="http://google.com/search" method="get">
<div style="background: #white; border: 4px solid #f7f6f2; border-radius: 3px; -webkit-box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0976562) 2px 2px 3px 0px; padding: 1em; margin: 1em 0">
<input type="search" name="q" placeholder="Search" results="0" style="font-size: 16px">
<input type="hidden" name="q" value="site:wiseheartdesign.com">
</div>
</form>

<p>The code above leverages a number of little known facts about <span class="caps">HTML</span> forms and Google:</p>

<ul>
<li>I’ve used two input elements to construct the query for Google. One is an HTML5 search input and the other is a hidden input element. But here’s the kicker: <strong>they both use the same name</strong> — in this case <code>q</code>. This will produce a query string that looks like this: <code>q=test&amp;q=...</code>. Note the presence of two <code>q</code> parameters. Google combines both parameters to create the complete search query.</li>
<li>The hidden input element has a value of <code>site:wiseheartdesign.com</code> which appends this to the end of the normal search string. Google uses this limit a search to a given website.</li>
<li>To cause the form to submit to Google, I’ve set the “action” attribute on the form to <code>http://google.com/search</code>. The “action” attribute can be a full <span class="caps">URL</span> to another site. It doesn’t have to refer to a <span class="caps">URL</span> on your own site.</li>
</ul>

  <p class="info">by <a href="/about/">John W. Long</a> on March 22, 2011</p>
  <p><img src="/page_attachments/0000/0116/design.jpg" align="right" /></p>
<p>With the number of products launched daily on the Web you might think that there would be more discussion about the usefulness of design as it applies to the startup. How do you choose the right level of design to test an idea or the viability of a product? Sadly, most discussion about the usefulness of design is made by people who believe that design has near-infinite value, very little value at all, or is just a mystery altogether.</p>

<p>Parts of the design community haven’t been very helpful on this point either, because frankly, our livelihood depends on people believing that design is extremely valuable (or so we believe). And let’s face it, designers want to be able to put that extra level of pizzaz into their designs. But that pizzaz comes with a price tag and it’s not always worth paying for.</p>

<p>So how do you make good decisions about the level of design that is needed for a product before launch and beyond? I would suggest that the answer lies in three key questions.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a little teaser image from some work that I&#8217;ve been doing rewriting the stylesheets of Radiant <span class="caps">CMS</span>. I&#8217;ve removed almost all of the background images in favor of CSS3 gradients and am working on a couple of other improvements.</p>

<p>One of the things that I&#8217;m playing around with is a new style for the second navigation row. This should allow us to put common actions on the toolbar like a &#8220;New Page&#8221; button.</p>

<p>For now, these changes are in an <a href="https://github.com/radiant/radiant-prototype/tree/brace">experimental branch</a> of the Radiant <span class="caps">CMS</span> prototype project. Check out <a href="https://github.com/radiant/radiant-prototype/compare/master...brace">the compare</a> to see how CSS3 and Compass are making Radiant better.</p>

  <p class="info">by <a href="/about/">John W. Long</a> on November 12, 2010</p>
  <p>The command prompt. Once the lofty domain of <em>that guy you know</em> with the computer science degree. Now more and more the every day domain of the <em><a href="http://twitter.com/zeldman/status/4818978868">hacker web designer</a></em>.</p>

<p>Perhaps you&#8217;ve mastered a little Javascript or PHP, but you are realizing that the cool kids are playing around with stuff that is only accessible to people who are comfortable with the command prompt. Or, perhaps you are just interested in upping your game.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, I&#8217;m here to help. In this brief introduction I&#8217;ll give you a small tour of command prompt on <span class="caps">OSX</span>. We&#8217;re only going to scratch the surface, but hopefully you&#8217;ll walk away with enough knowledge to get you started. With just a little know-how you&#8217;ll be hopping around the command prompt typing out shell incantations like a pro.</p>

<p>This morning I uploaded a new demo the <a href="http://github.com/chriseppstein/sass-recipes/">Sass Recipes repository</a> based on work for <a href="http://memberhub.com">MemberHub.com</a> showing how easy it is to create a multi-line buttons with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>, and CSS3.</p>

<p><a href="http://chriseppstein.github.com/sass-recipes/recipes/multi-line-button/multi-line-button.html">View the Demo</a></p>

<p>Believe it or not, I created the buttons in the demo without using a single image. Normally, this kind of button is so complex that designers create the finished buttons as images rather than spending the time to style them using pure <span class="caps">CSS</span>. <span class="caps">CSS</span> for this type of thing is error prone and typically requires the use of multiple background images.</p>

<p>Until now.</p>

<p>CSS3 makes it possible to achieve this effect without images. And Compass makes it easy to use these advanced CSS3 features in a concise way that works across modern browsers.</p>

  <h2><a href="/articles/2010/10/04/new-memberhub-home-page/">New MemberHub Home Page</a></h2>
  <p class="info">by <a href="/about/">John W. Long</a> on October  4, 2010</p>
  <p><a href="/articles/2010/10/04/new-memberhub-home-page/"><img src="/page_attachments/0000/0090/memberhub-top.png" /></a></p>

<p>Last week I helped MemberHub launch a revised version of their <a href="http://memberhub.com">home page</a>. This is a bit of a stealth redesign in that we maintained the look and feel of the <a href="/images/portfolio/memberhub.png">previous version</a>, but we did a lot to both expand and simplify the message.</p>

<p>The first thing you might notice is that we simplified our tag-line/introduction. Instead of a header + paragraph introduction we reduced it to a single tag-line. <em>Engage your members and streamline communications with one simple tool.</em> While more information was being presented with the header + paragraph approach, we feel that this simple sentence packs more punch and gets right to the heart of what MemberHub provides.</p>

<p><img src="/page_attachments/0000/0096/memberhub-tagline.png" /></p>

<p>We also replaced the <em>Get Started</em> form with a simple <em>Start Free Trial</em> button. Originally that &#8220;Get Started&#8221; form allowed a user to type a name for a hub and instantly jump into the signup process for a free hub. But we long ago abandoned pushing free hubs in favor of our organization offering. When we did that, we modified the form to kickoff the organization signup process instead, but never took the time to rethink what should actually be there. The new &#8220;Start Free Trial&#8221; button drastically simplifies the process and again, gets to the point faster.</p>

<p>The third thing we did was simplify the screenshot area. We moved the &#8220;View the Product Tour&#8221; link under our main call-to-action, and dropped the stock photography in favor of a larger screenshot.</p>

<p>One of our goals for this revision was to push our customers front and center. We wanted it to be clear that people are finding MemberHub useful for all kinds of organizations. The blue &#8220;Every day&#8230;&#8221; section accomplishes this goal quite well and the quotes below reinforce that message with real testimonies from people in different verticals.</p>

<p>I gave a talk last night at the <a href="http://refreshthetriangle.com">local Refresh chapter</a> here in Raleigh. It was a great time. People asked good questions and I fielded their questions as best I could.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the gist of the talk:</p>

<p>With modern development tools it&#8217;s far too easy to build too much software too fast without spending adequate time developing your customer base. Successful products solve a real needs. No matter how good your idea is, you need to spend time talking to the people who will actually use (and buy) your product. But it&#8217;s not enough just to talk to them. You need to have something to talk about.</p>

<p>This is where rapid prototyping can really help. Rapid prototyping allows you to show something to your customers early in your development cycle so that you can begin getting the feedback that will be crucial to the success of your project.</p>

<p>For Web applications, there are at least five different tools that you can use to &#8220;prototype&#8221; your project and get feedback early:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whiteboards</li>
  <li>Wireframes</li>
  <li>Hi-fi mockups</li>
  <li><span class="caps">HTML</span> prototypes</li>
  <li>Functional prototypes</li>
</ul>

<p>We discussed the pros and cons of each approach and then talked about what makes for good customer development.</p>

<p>Good customer development involves four things:</p>

<ol>
 <li>An idea</li>
 <li>An assertion</li>
 <li>An experiment</li>
 <li>Customer feedback</li>
</ol>

<p>You start with your idea. This is the big overarching idea for your product. I want to build a product that revolutionizes X by doing Y better than anyone else. You then make an assertion about your idea. In order to do this, I believe that we must do Z really well. You then design an experiment in order to validate your assertion. Finally you take that experiment to your customers and get their feedback on it.</p>

<p>The important thing here is that you are boiling your idea down into something practical. For example, when 37signals created Basecamp (a popular project management system) they felt that the entire thing would fail if they didn&#8217;t make it easy to communicate about a project (their assertion). So they set about building the messages section of Basecamp first (this was even before they had done anything with to-do lists or milestones).</p>

<p>Identify the heart of your application and start there. A good way of identifying the heart of your application is to ask the question: What&#8217;s the most important part of the application to get right to test our core idea?</p>

<p>As soon as you have something to show off (a prototype of some kind), you should begin getting feedback from potential customers. You will want to ask questions like: What do you think about how this works? Should we remove anything? How can we make this better? And of course, the big one: Would you actually pay money for this? How much?</p>

<p>Based on what you learn from your customers you&#8217;ll need to revisit your idea. Does anything need to change there? Does anything about our revolutionary idea need to change? After reevaluating your idea, you should make new assertions and build new experiments around those assertions. This is a cycle, from idea to customer feedback, and back again.</p>

<p>A couple of notes. If you show something to a potential customer and they give you negative feedback that is an extremely good thing. Experiments are successful whenever they generate feedback (good or bad). Take what you learn and integrate it into your development process. Don&#8217;t be afraid to throw stuff away. One of the primary goals of a good customer development cycle is to maximize learning. After all we are trying to build a successful product here. We want to know early on if people like what we are building and if they will actually use it.</p>

<p>Of course, there is a lot that could be said here to balance and expand upon the ideas presented here. It is important to stay true to your vision for the product &#8212; to stick to your guns so-to-speak. But it&#8217;s also important to validate those ideas with serious customer development.</p>
