<meta name="summary" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=timestamp&gt;Updated: Oct. 18, 2012&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter, which was created by a 10-person startup in San Francisco called Obvious, is a heady mixture of messaging, social networking, microblogging and &#8220;presence,&#8221; shorthand for the idea that people should enjoy an &#8220;always on&#8221; virtual omnipresence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter&#8217;s rapid growth made it the object of intense interest and a fair amount of ridicule, as it was derided as high-tech trivia or the latest in time-wasting devices. But its use in Iran in the wake of the disputed presidential election of June 2009 to organize protests and disseminate information in the face of a news media crackdown brought it new respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Twitter seems ubiquitous. Bankrolled by venture capitalists, it has grown into a multibillion-dollar enterprise with 140 million users worldwide. Although the company doesn&#8217;t share its financials, it is estimated that it will have $350 million in revenue in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2011, Twitter raised $400 million from private investors. The fund-raising effort, led by DST Global, the investment firm headed by the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, valued the company at $8 billion. In December 2011, Prince &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/walid_bin_talal/index.html?inline=nyt-per&gt;Walid bin Talal&lt;/a&gt; of Saudi Arabia &lt;a href=http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/saudi-prince-invests-300-million-in-twitter/?hp&gt;announced he had taken a $300 million stake&lt;/a&gt; in the company, representing roughly 3 percent. On paper, Twitter is valued at close to $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/technology/dick-costolo-of-twitter-an-improv-master-writing-its-script.html?ref=twitter&gt; Its next big step is to go public on the stock market,&lt;/a&gt; and insiders say the current goal is to have an initial public offering in 2014. But those plans now are being discussed in light of a somber case study: Twitter&#8217;s social media twin, Facebook, has already gone public, of course &#8212; and, so far, Facebook stockholders have lost billions, at least on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blocking Neo-Nazi Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sign of its increasing reach and influence, Twitter has become to face some of the same thorny free speech issues that have confronted Google and Facebook. In October 2012, Twitter &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/world/europe/twitter-blocks-access-to-neo-nazi-group-in-germany.html?ref=twitter&gt;blocked users in Germany from access to the account of a neo-Nazi group&lt;/a&gt; that is banned by the government. It was the first time acted on a policy known as &#8220;country-withheld content,&#8221; announced in January, which the company says is meant to balance freedom of expression with compliance with local laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German authorities in the state of Lower Saxony in September had banned the group, Besseres Hannover, which means &#8220;better Hannover.&#8221; The German police requested in a letter posted online by Twitter that the group&#8217;s account be shut down entirely. Instead, only access in Germany was blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the appeal of Twitter to its users relies on the wide-open nature of the exchanges: sometimes profane, often silly, but for activists in repressive countries, also a deadly serious business. The announcement of the country-withheld content policy prompted significant outrage among users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=showhidetxt&gt;&lt;a id=more title=More href=javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');&gt;Read More...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=moretxt&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Partnership With Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2012, people briefed on the matter said that &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/apple_computer_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, which has stumbled in its efforts to get into social media, &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/28/technology/apple-is-said-to-discuss-an-investment-in-twitter.html?pagewanted=1&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;ref=business&gt;had talked with Twitter about making a strategic investment in it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has considered an investment in the hundreds of millions of dollars, one that could value Twitter at more than $10 billion, up from an $8.4 billion valuation in 2011, these people said. They declined to be named because the discussions were private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no guarantee that the two companies will come to an agreement. But they may form a stronger partnership amid intensifying competition from the likes of &lt;a title=Google Inc. href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/google_inc/index.html?8qa&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/facebook_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter and Apple have already been working together. Apple has tightly sewn Twitter features into its software for phones, tablets and computers, while, behind the scenes, Twitter has put more resources into managing its relationship with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Twitter does not need Apple&#8217;s cash. Earlier in 2012, Dick Costolo, Twitter&#8217;s chief executive, said the company had &#8220;truckloads of money in the bank.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truckloads, according to people familiar with the matter, add up to more than $600 million in cash on hand. This comes from the $1 billion in financing it has raised over the years and, more recently, from a healthy flow of advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, Twitter is widely expected to pursue a public offering within the next couple of years, whether or not it agrees to deals with investors like Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple and Twitter are logical partners in some ways. Unlike Facebook or Google, Twitter has no plans to compete with Apple in the phone business or elsewhere. And as Apple has found, social is just not in its DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Basics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Twitterers&#8221; or &#8220;tweeters&#8221; send and receive short messages, called &#8220;tweets,&#8221; on Twitter&#8217;s Web site, with instant messaging software, or with mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user is logged in through the Web or a cellphone, it asks one simple question, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; Users answer in 140 characters or fewer. While some of these tweets have the profundity of haiku, most are mundane, like &#8220;Sure is pretty out tonight&#8221; or &#8220;My eyes itch. I am very aggravated.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most text messages, tweets are routed among networks of friends. Strangers, called &#8220;followers,&#8221; can also choose to receive the tweets of people they find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing Tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its short history, Twitter has become an important marketing tool for celebrities, politicians and businesses, promising a level of intimacy never before approached online, as well as giving the public the ability to speak directly to people and institutions once comfortably on a pedestal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But someone has to do all that writing, even if each entry is barely a sentence long. In many cases, celebrities and their handlers have turned to outside writers &#8212; ghost Twitterers, who keep fans updated on the latest twists and turns, often in the star&#8217;s own voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not only celebrities who are forced to look to a team to produce real-time commentary on daily activities, but also politicians like Ron Paul, who have assigned staff members to create Twitter posts and Facebook personas. Barack Obama&#8217;s presidential campaign used Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizing Tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, people in Iran and Moldova created their own searchable tags on Twitter to organize protests against their governments and share information with each other and the world. Moldovans used the network to rally more than 10,000 young people against their country&#8217;s Communist leadership. And Iranian opposition supporters angry over presidential election results used Twitter and other forms of new media to share news on rallies, police crackdowns on protesters, and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the authorities blocking text-messaging on cellphones, Twitter became a handy alternative for information-hungry Iranians. While Iran tried to block Twitter posts, Iranians were skilled at using proxy sites or other methods to circumvent the official barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a notable moment during the Iranian protests, a State Department official e-mailed Twitter to request a delay in scheduled maintenance of its global network, which would have cut off service while Iranians were using Twitter to swap information and inform the outside world about the mushrooming protests around Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter complied with the request and briefly postponed its upgrade. The episode demonstrated the extent to which the Obama administration views social networking as a new diplomatic tool. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton talks regularly about the power of e-diplomacy, particularly in places where the mass media are repressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Court Order Involving WikiLeaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2011, a federal judge ruled that &lt;a title=Twitter Ordered to Yield Data in WikiLeaks Case href=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/11/technology/twitter-ordered-to-yield-data-in-wikileaks-case.html?scp=2&amp;amp;sq=Twitter&amp;amp;st=cse&gt;Twitter must reveal information about three of its account holders&lt;/a&gt; who were under investigation for their possible links to the &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/wikileaks/index.html?inline=nyt-org&gt;WikiLeaks&lt;/a&gt; whistle-blower site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case had become a flash point for online privacy and speech, in part because the Justice Department had sought the information without a search warrant. Instead, on the basis of a 1994 law called the Stored Communications Act, the government demanded that Twitter provide the Internet protocol addresses of three of its users. An Internet protocol address identifies and gives the location of a computer used to log onto the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter informed the three people &#8212; Jacob Appelbaum, an American computer security expert, along with Rop Gonggrijp, a Dutch citizen, and Birgitta Jonsdottir, a member of Iceland&#8217;s Parliament &#8212; of the government&#8217;s demand for information earlier in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petitioners argued in federal court that their Internet protocol addresses should be considered private information and that the demand for information was too broad and unrelated to WikiLeaks. They also argued that the order suppressed their right to free speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court disagreed. Judge Liam O&#8217;Grady, from the United States District Court in Alexandria, Va., said that because Twitter users &#8220;voluntarily&#8221; turned over the Internet protocol addresses when they signed up for an account, they relinquished an expectation of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=showhidetxt&gt;&lt;a id=more title=Hide href=javascript:toggleLayer('more'); javascript:toggleLayer2('moretxt');&gt;Hide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In October 2012, Twitter <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/world/europe/twitter-blocks-access-to-neo-nazi-group-in-germany.html?ref=twitter">blocked users in Germany from access to the account of a neo-Nazi group</a> that is banned by the government. It was the first time acted on a policy known as &#8220;country-withheld content,&#8221; announced in January, which the company says is meant to balance freedom of expression with compliance with local laws.</p>
<p>German authorities in the state of Lower Saxony in September had banned the group, Besseres Hannover, which means &#8220;better Hannover.&#8221; The German police requested in a letter posted online by Twitter that the group&#8217;s account be shut down entirely. Instead, only access in Germany was blocked.</p>
<p>Much of the appeal of Twitter to its users relies on the wide-open nature of the exchanges: sometimes profane, often silly, but for activists in repressive countries, also a deadly serious business. The announcement of the country-withheld content policy prompted significant outrage among users.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Partnership With Apple</strong></p>
<p>In July 2012, people briefed on the matter said that <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/apple_computer_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Apple</a>, which has stumbled in its efforts to get into social media, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/28/technology/apple-is-said-to-discuss-an-investment-in-twitter.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=business">had talked with Twitter about making a strategic investment in it.</a></p>
<p>Apple has considered an investment in the hundreds of millions of dollars, one that could value Twitter at more than $10 billion, up from an $8.4 billion valuation in 2011, these people said. They declined to be named because the discussions were private.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that the two companies will come to an agreement. But they may form a stronger partnership amid intensifying competition from the likes of <a title="Google Inc." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/google_inc/index.html?8qa">Google</a> and <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/facebook_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter and Apple have already been working together. Apple has tightly sewn Twitter features into its software for phones, tablets and computers, while, behind the scenes, Twitter has put more resources into managing its relationship with Apple.</p>
<p>But Twitter does not need Apple&#8217;s cash. Earlier in 2012, Dick Costolo, Twitter&#8217;s chief executive, said the company had &#8220;truckloads of money in the bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>The truckloads, according to people familiar with the matter, add up to more than $600 million in cash on hand. This comes from the $1 billion in financing it has raised over the years and, more recently, from a healthy flow of advertising revenue.</p>
<p>Regardless, Twitter is widely expected to pursue a public offering within the next couple of years, whether or not it agrees to deals with investors like Apple.</p>
<p>Apple and Twitter are logical partners in some ways. Unlike Facebook or Google, Twitter has no plans to compete with Apple in the phone business or elsewhere. And as Apple has found, social is just not in its DNA.</p>
<p><strong>The Basics</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Twitterers&#8221; or &#8220;tweeters&#8221; send and receive short messages, called &#8220;tweets,&#8221; on Twitter&#8217;s Web site, with instant messaging software, or with mobile phones.</p>
<p>When a user is logged in through the Web or a cellphone, it asks one simple question, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; Users answer in 140 characters or fewer. While some of these tweets have the profundity of haiku, most are mundane, like &#8220;Sure is pretty out tonight&#8221; or &#8220;My eyes itch. I am very aggravated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike most text messages, tweets are routed among networks of friends. Strangers, called &#8220;followers,&#8221; can also choose to receive the tweets of people they find interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing Tool</strong></p>
<p>In its short history, Twitter has become an important marketing tool for celebrities, politicians and businesses, promising a level of intimacy never before approached online, as well as giving the public the ability to speak directly to people and institutions once comfortably on a pedestal.</p>
<p>But someone has to do all that writing, even if each entry is barely a sentence long. In many cases, celebrities and their handlers have turned to outside writers &#8212; ghost Twitterers, who keep fans updated on the latest twists and turns, often in the star&#8217;s own voice.</p>
<p>It is not only celebrities who are forced to look to a team to produce real-time commentary on daily activities, but also politicians like Ron Paul, who have assigned staff members to create Twitter posts and Facebook personas. Barack Obama&#8217;s presidential campaign used Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.</p>
<p><strong>Organizing Tool</strong></p>
<p>In 2009, people in Iran and Moldova created their own searchable tags on Twitter to organize protests against their governments and share information with each other and the world. Moldovans used the network to rally more than 10,000 young people against their country&#8217;s Communist leadership. And Iranian opposition supporters angry over presidential election results used Twitter and other forms of new media to share news on rallies, police crackdowns on protesters, and analysis.</p>
<p>With the authorities blocking text-messaging on cellphones, Twitter became a handy alternative for information-hungry Iranians. While Iran tried to block Twitter posts, Iranians were skilled at using proxy sites or other methods to circumvent the official barriers.</p>
<p>In a notable moment during the Iranian protests, a State Department official e-mailed Twitter to request a delay in scheduled maintenance of its global network, which would have cut off service while Iranians were using Twitter to swap information and inform the outside world about the mushrooming protests around Tehran.</p>
<p>Twitter complied with the request and briefly postponed its upgrade. The episode demonstrated the extent to which the Obama administration views social networking as a new diplomatic tool. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton talks regularly about the power of e-diplomacy, particularly in places where the mass media are repressed.</p>
<p><strong>A Court Order Involving WikiLeaks</strong></p>
<p>In November 2011, a federal judge ruled that <a title="Twitter Ordered to Yield Data in WikiLeaks Case" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/11/technology/twitter-ordered-to-yield-data-in-wikileaks-case.html?scp=2&amp;sq=Twitter&amp;st=cse">Twitter must reveal information about three of its account holders</a> who were under investigation for their possible links to the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/wikileaks/index.html?inline=nyt-org">WikiLeaks</a> whistle-blower site.</p>
<p>The case had become a flash point for online privacy and speech, in part because the Justice Department had sought the information without a search warrant. Instead, on the basis of a 1994 law called the Stored Communications Act, the government demanded that Twitter provide the Internet protocol addresses of three of its users. An Internet protocol address identifies and gives the location of a computer used to log onto the Internet.</p>
<p>Twitter informed the three people &#8212; Jacob Appelbaum, an American computer security expert, along with Rop Gonggrijp, a Dutch citizen, and Birgitta Jonsdottir, a member of Iceland&#8217;s Parliament &#8212; of the government&#8217;s demand for information earlier in 2011.</p>
<p>The petitioners argued in federal court that their Internet protocol addresses should be considered private information and that the demand for information was too broad and unrelated to WikiLeaks. They also argued that the order suppressed their right to free speech.</p>
<p>The court disagreed. Judge Liam O&#8217;Grady, from the United States District Court in Alexandria, Va., said that because Twitter users &#8220;voluntarily&#8221; turned over the Internet protocol addresses when they signed up for an account, they relinquished an expectation of privacy.</p>
