Latest Version: 3.3

<P><B>ftnchek</B> is a static analyzer for Fortran 77 programs. It is designed
to detect certain errors in a Fortran program that a compiler usually does
not. ftnchek is not primarily intended to detect syntax errors. Its purpose
is to assist the user in finding semantic errors. Semantic errors are legal
in the Fortran language but are wasteful or may cause incorrect operation.
For example, variables which are never used may indicate some omission
in the program; uninitialized variables contain garbage which may cause
incorrect results to be calculated; and variables which are not declared
may not have the intended type. ftnchek is intended to assist users in
the debugging of their Fortran program. It is not intended to catch all
syntax errors. This is the function of the compiler. Prior to using ftnchek,
the user should verify that the program compiles correctly. </P>

<P>This move happened only recently, and so the SourceForge project
site for ftnchek is still under development.  You should still come to
this location for downloads of the distribution source code or binary
executables.  For those who would like to assist in the development of
ftnchek, the most recent source code (still experimental) can be
checked out from the CVS repository at SourceForge.
