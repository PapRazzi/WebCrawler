Welcome to our WWW page introducing our research in object-oriented
programming using the Fortran 90 programming language. Fortran 90 is
a modern language that introduces many important new features
beneficial for scientific programming. While the array-syntax
notation has received the most attention, we have found that many
modern software development techniques can be supported by this
language, including object-oriented concepts.<P>

While Fortran 90 is not a full object-oriented language it can
directly support many of the important concepts of such languages
including abstract data types, encapsulation, function overloading,
and classes. Other concepts, such as inheritance and dynamic
dispatching, are not supported directly, but can be emulated.  (Direct
support is a
<A HREF="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~szymansk/OOF90/f2000.html" TARGET=_parent">
Fortran 2000</A> requirement.)  Since Fortran 90 is
backward compatible with Fortran 77, new concepts can be introduced
into existing programs in a controlled manner. This allows
experienced Fortran 77 programmers to modernize their software,
making it easier to understand, modify, share, explain, and extend
based on the benefits modern programming principles provide.<P>

For a short summary of the major points see<B>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~nortonc/OOF90/Forum.html"
TARGET=_parent>"Expressing
Object-Oriented Concepts in Fortran 90"</A></B>, which  appeared
in the ACM Fortran Forum, vol. 16, num. 1, April 1997.<P>

See <B>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~szymansk/OOF90/F90_Objects.html"
TARGET=_parent>"Introduction to
Object-Oriented Concepts Using Fortran 90".</A></B> for a more
detailed, but still simplified discussion (subtyping and
dynamic dispatching are not discussed here).<P>

We have written a variety of object-oriented plasma particle-in-cell
programs on sequential workstations and high performance distributed
memory computers in Fortran 90 and C++.  <FONT COLOR=aa0000> All of
our Fortran 90 programs execute more quickly than the equivalent C++
versions, yet the abstraction modeling capabilities that we needed
were comparably powerful.  </FONT> We encourage you to
explore these pages and to contact us directly with your questions and
commentary.<P>

For beginners to Fortran 90 we recommend F, a subset language
which includes all of the new modern features of Fortran 90
and excludes the less desirable features. F is simple, inexpensive,
and encourages good programming style compatible with Fortran 90.
