                Google Fiber Privacy Notice
              </h1>
              <p>
                The <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a>
                applies to all of the services offered by Google Inc. and its affiliates, including
                Google Fiber Internet and Google Fiber TV, which are provided by Google Fiber, Inc.
              </p>
              <p>
                This Google Fiber Privacy Notice explains some important additional things we’d
                like you to know about information we collect when you visit Fiber websites or
                regarding use of Google Fiber TV and Google Fiber Internet (we call these together
                “Fiber”), and how that information is used.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Additional information we collect</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                To sign up for Fiber, users will be asked to provide an existing Google Account or
                to create a new one. You may be asked to provide additional personal information,
                such as billing address, service address or location, or bank account information
                when you sign up for Fiber.
              </p>
              <p>
                We may also obtain and use information about our Fiber users from outside sources
                for marketing purposes (such as commercially available demographic, geographic, or
                interest information).
              </p>
              <p>
                We may have a record of whether third party permission was required to install
                Fiber equipment for a Fiber user, as well as the third party’s name and contact
                information. In order to carry out a request to watch a pay-per-view program or
                other on-demand content, we may collect certain personal information, such as
                account or billing information and information about the product or service
                purchased.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the initial provisioning or installation of Fiber services, and during any
                subsequent changes, updates or attempts to resolve issues you bring to our
                attention, we may access, and collect technical information from or about,
                televisions, set-top boxes, computer and network hardware and software, modems, or
                other systems or devices used in connection with Fiber.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>How we use information we collect</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                The <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a>
                explains how we use information we collect.
              </p>
              <p>
                All information we collect about the use of Google Fiber TV (including use of
                programs and applications available through Google Fiber TV) may be associated with
                the Google Account being used for Google Fiber TV.
              </p>
              <p>
                Technical information collected from the use of Google Fiber Internet for network
                management, security or maintenance may be associated with the Google Account you
                use for Fiber, but such information associated with the Google Account you use for
                Fiber will not be used by other Google properties without your consent. Other
                information from the use of Google Fiber Internet (such as URLs of websites visited
                or content of communications) will not be associated with the Google Account you
                use for Fiber, except with your consent or to meet any applicable law, regulation,
                legal process or enforceable governmental request.
              </p>
              <p>
                This notice does not apply to the collection and use of information from other
                Google services (such as Gmail or Google Search) used while connected to Google
                Fiber Internet -- such information will be treated in accordance with applicable
                Google policies and terms of service.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Information we share</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals
                outside of Google except in the circumstances (such as with your consent, with
                domain administrators, for external processing and for legal reasons) as more fully
                set out in the <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy
                Policy</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners
                – like content providers, publishers, advertisers or connected sites.
