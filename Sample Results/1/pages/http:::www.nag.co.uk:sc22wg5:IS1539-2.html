<BR>
This standard is Part 2 of the <A HREF="IS1539_family.html">multi-part
family of Fortran Standards</A>, and describes a set of additional
procedures that can be used to provide a varying length character
string capability for Fortran 95 programs.

<P> The Standard includes an informative annexe containing a reference to a
complete <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.nag.co.uk/sc22wg5/ISO_VARYING_STRING"> Fortran 95 module </A> which
could be used as a portable implementation.<P>

Although ISO copyright practice does not permit the text of the International Standard to be made generally available, the document submitted for the FCD ballot is available from the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.nag.co.uk/sc22wg5">WG5 file server</A> as WG5/N1375 in both Acrobat (pdf) and PostScript formats.  Although this document has no formal status, the only changes subsequently made were entirely editorial and typographical.<P>
