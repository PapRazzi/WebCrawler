    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions about <tt>C--</tt></h2>

    <h3>What machines does the compiler support?</h3>

    As of May 2004, only
    the <strong>Pentium</strong> back end is as expressive as a C&nbsp;compiler.
    The <strong>Alpha</strong> and <strong>Mips</strong> back ends can
    run hello, world.
    We are working on back ends for <strong>PowerPC</strong> (Mac OS&nbsp;X),
    <strong>ARM</strong>, and <strong>IA-64</strong>.
    Let us know what other platforms you are interested in.

    <h3>How is C-- different from JVM or CLR?</h3>


   A major purpose of C-- is to give you the power to make all the
   same choices about performance tradeoffs that you would get to make
   if you were building a custom code generator.
   This attitude distinguishes
   C-- from the Java Virtual Machine or Microsoft's Common Language
   Runtime, which pre-package JIT
   compilation, type checking, class loading, garbage collection,
   exception dispatch, and much more besides.  If the JVM is a mansion
   (great if you like its design), then C-- is the bricks (from which you
   can build all sorts of houses).

    <h3>Why doesn't the system include a garbage collector?</h3>

   A garbage collector fixes many design choices, such
   as heap object layout and relocatability, allocation strategy, real-time
   bounds and so on.  If we made these choices for you, we would be
   guaranteed to make the wrong ones!
   Instead C-- provides the hooks you can use to attach your
   <em>own</em>
   garbage collector.  You write your garbage collector in C (a
   programming language), not C-- (an assembly language).  At some point
   in your collector you probably need to traverse the stack to find the
   live roots; you use the C interface to the C-- runtime system to do
   that.
    

    <h3>Relationship to C</h3>

    <h4>Why isn't <tt>C--</tt> a superset of C?</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>C&nbsp; is a <em>programming language</em> designed for
      human programmers, whereas <tt>C--</tt> is a <em>compiler
      target language</em>. So C&nbsp; has many things that are
      entirely unnecessary for <tt>C--</tt>; requiring a <tt>
      C--</tt> compiler to support them would be exceptionally
      burdensome. Most notably, C&nbsp;has an elaborate type system
      that we don't need for code generation (struct, union,
      prototype, and all that).</li>

      <li>There are a few features in C&nbsp; that are actually
      incompatible with <tt>C--</tt>, most notably support for
      varargs procedures (that is, procedures with a variable
      number of arguments). It seems impossible to have both
      C-style varargs and efficient, fully-general tail calls (which <tt>
      C--</tt> must have).  

      <li><tt>C--</tt> deliberately provides different notation for
      many things that C can do. For example, where C would have
      "<tt>*p</tt>", we write "<tt>bits32[p]</tt>" in <tt>
      C--</tt>.</li>

      <li>The C&nbsp;standard leaves too much up to the
      implementation, including the representations of structures,
      the sizes of the built-in types, and the meanings of the
      operators. C&nbsp;operators can have side effects, and the
      order of their evaluation is unspecified. Implementing other
      languages on top of <tt>C--</tt> requires finer control. For
      example, Modula-3 requires division that rounds towards minus
      infinity, not towards zero. Standard&nbsp;ML requires
      arithmetic operations that detect overflow.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>OK, then why isn't <tt>C--</tt> a subset of C?</h4>
    For efficient compilation of modern languages, we need features
    that C&nbsp;just doesn't provide efficiently: 

    <ul>
      <li>Ability to return multiple values in registers</li>

      <li>Optimized tail calls to any procedure</li>

      <li>Global variables bound to registers

      <li>Ways to tie garbage-collection information to particular
      program points</li>

      <li>Support for exceptions</li>

      <li>Support for lightweight concurrency</li>
    </ul>
    The latter three are the real killers: <tt>C--</tt> provides a
    run-time interface that allows the state of a suspended <tt>
    C--</tt> computation to be inspected and modified at runtime. C
    has no equivalent for this. 

    <h3><A name=notypes>How does C-- differ from UNCOL?</notypes></h3>

    The goal of UNCOL was to provide a universal intermediate language.
    The goal of C-- is more modest: to encapsulate what code generators 
    already do well.
    We don't claim you could do any more with C-- than you could do with a standard 
    code generator; we're just trying to make it easier to do those
    things.
    <p>
    A key distinguishing feature of C-- is the data model.
    Put simply, C-- has no high-level types---it does not even
    distinguish floating-point variables from integer variables.
    This model gives the front end total control of representation and
    type system, which is quite different from an UNCOL.
    This data model also helps distinguish C-- from systems like the
    Java Virtual Machine and the Microsoft Common Language Runtime.

    <h3>Why is the syntax of C-- so C-like?</h3>

We expect that compiler writers will have to read a lot of C-- while
they're debugging their front ends.   Many compiler writers
have significant experience reading low-level C code; making the
syntax C-like helps them benefit from this experience.
There are a number of syntactic tweaks in C-- that make it easier to
generate than&nbsp;C; for example, every operator has a prefix form,
so it's not necessary to use infix operators.

    <h3>Why is the domain name not <tt>c--.org</tt>?</h3>
    The <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/">Evil Empire</a>
    refuses even to consider registering a domain name that ends
    with a dash. 

    <h3>Where is the Source Code?</h3>
    Get it from our <a href='./rsync.html'>rsync</a> server or try the
    <a href='./code.html'>C-- Downloads</a> page.

    <h3>What about that other <tt>C--</tt>?</h3>
    C-- is such a good name that others have also used it. 

    <ul> <li>Peter Cellik developed <i>Sphinx C--</i> as a programming
      language for the x86 only; it is like a mix of C and x86 assembly
      language. The project was
      <a href=http://c--sphinx.narod.ru/indexe.htm>taken over</a> by <a
      href="http://www.sheker.chat.ru/index_e.htm">Michael Sheker</a>.
      Barry Kauler has <a href="http://www.goosee.com/cmm/">more
      information</a> about Sphinx C-- and a translation of the <a
      href="http://www.goosee.com/cmm/c--doc.htm">documentation</a> to
      English. 
    
      
      </li>

      <li>The <a href="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~thpproj/RIF/">
      Riverside Intermediate Format</a> uses a source language
      called C--, which is a subset of Gnu&nbsp;C.</li>
 
      <li>One of the intermediate codes of the 
          <A href="http://caml.inria.fr">Objective Caml</a> compiler
          is called C--.  Simon has been suspected of stealing the
          name from this source.

      <li><a href=http://www.personal.leeds.ac.uk/~ecldh/>David Holdsworth</a>
 and colleagues are using the name C-- 
  for an
  <a href=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/CAMiLEON/dh/cingahd.html>emulation platform.</a> 


    </ul>

    <h3>Is this a secret Microsoft project?</h3>
    <a href='./people.html'>Simon Peyton Jones</a> does work for <a href= 
    "http://research.microsoft.com">Microsoft Research</a>, but
    <tt>C--</tt> is not a Microsoft project. C-- is open source;
    the <a href='./code.html'>code</a> is available to everyone.

    <h3>Does <tt>C--</tt> provide the <tt>%xyz</tt> primitive?</h3>
    Eventually we will divide the primitive operations into two
    categories:<br>
     <br>
     

    <ul>
      <li>Required operations, which must be supported by every
      implementation, at at least one size.</li>

      <li>Optional operations, which if supported, must have the
      standard semantics.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> The picture about sizes is less clear. For example,
    although we expect to require every implementation to implement
    two's-complement add, we can't imagine requiring every
    implementation to implement 32-bit two's-complement add.</p>

    <p>The reason for adding all known operations to C-- as
    standard opcodes is to encourage different implementations to
    use the same name for the same operation. Eventually we hope to
    have a <i>register a new primitive operator</i> page at
    cminusminus.org.</p>

<p>
    <h3><tt>C--</tt>  has no primitive operators that return multiple
        results.  But my target machine has a single instruction that performs both
        quotient and remainder.  What do I do?</h3>


  Ideally,  the <tt>C--</tt> compiler would
     spot separate <tt>%quot</tt> and <tt>%rem</tt> operations and combine
 them.  But you might want to use a multiple
assignment to communicate your intentions to the code generator, e.g.,
<pre>
  q, r = %quot(x, y), %rem(x, y);
</pre>
We don't have enough peephole optimization yet to know
if this style will make a difference, but it can't hurt.
