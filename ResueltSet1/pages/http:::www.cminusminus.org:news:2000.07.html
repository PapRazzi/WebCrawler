    <h1>C-- News for July, 2000</h1>

Here is the C-- news as of July, 2000.
<ol>
<li>At the beginning of April,
<a href='../people.html'>Christian Lindig</a> joined the project full-time.
Christian is based at Harvard and is working primarily on the
implementation of Quick C--.
He moonlights as a webjack of all trades.

<li><tt><a href=http://www.cminusminus.org/>www.cminusminus.org</a></tt> is up!
In addition to being the definitive source of information about C--, this site also
provides access to source code via <a href=../rsync.html>rsync server</a>.

<li>The <a href=../mail.html>mailing list</a> has moved to  
<tt><a href=http://www.cminusminus.org/>cminusminus.org</a></tt>.
Current subscribers have been moved automatically.
At some point, the list at Glasgow will become a pointer to 
<tt><a href=mailto:cminusminus@cminusminus.org>cminusminus@cminusminus.org</a></tt>.

<li>Our <a href="../abstracts/c--pldi-00.html">paper on exceptions</a> was
delivered at PLDI at the end of June.
With this paper and the
<a href="../abstracts/ppdp.html">garbage-collection paper</a> we
believe we have a strong design for the next version of C-- and its
run-time system.

<li>The details of both the C-- language and its run-time system are in
the midst of a major shake-up in preparation for <strong>Version&nbsp;2, which will
incorporate support for garbage collection and exception
handling.</strong>
Details on the <a href='../progress.html'>work-in-progress page</a>.

<li>We've been hard at work on <a href='../concurrency.html'>concurrency</a>, and we have 
developed a good deal of raw material, which we hope will
eventually jell into a design.
It's not too early to provide feedback.

<li><a href='../qc--.html'>Quick C--</a>  can now check the static semantics of C-- programs.
</ol>
<p>
Here are our plans for the next six to nine months.
<ol>

<li>We hope to refine our ideas about concurrency, but our real work will
be on implementation.

<li>Fermin plans to <b>investigate the experimental costs of
splitting garbage-collection support between front and back ends</b>.
He'll be extending <a href= "http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~reig/c--/">cmmc</a>
 to support the garbage-collection part of the
C-- run-time interface, and he'll be writing a C-- code generator for
<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/">Objective Caml</a> to do the
investigation.

<li>Christian and Norman are hard at work on <a href='../qc--.html'>Quick C--</a>.
Here's a tentative timetable:
<ul>
<li>Generate intermediate code (1 month)
<li>Instruction selection (1--2 months)
<li>Register allocation (1--2 months)
<li>Calling conventions (1--2 months)
<li>Convert to assembly language and emit (1 month)
<li>Support for the run-time interface (2 months)
</ul>
We hope to be generating code by late winter or early spring.
</ol>
By late spring, 2001, we hope people will be coupling front ends to
C--.
