  How can I keep up with changes to the Twitter API?  </h3>  <p> There are a two great ways to follow the changes we make to the Twitter platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow @<a href="http://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=twitterapi">twitterapi</a>.</li>
<li>Keep track of our <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog">Developer Blog</a> and <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/discussions">Discussions</a>.</li>
<li>See the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/recent">recently updated documentation</a>.</li>
</ul></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="5810">
  How do I count out 140 characters?  </h3>  <p> While Tweets are still limited to 140 characters, the character counting model has evolved over time. Tweets are UTF-8 string content and any UTF-8 character counts as a single character. Strings that are understood as links, such as "http://twitter.com", "twitter.com", "twitter.com/twitterapi" will be automatically converted to t.co. t.co links represent a variant character count (currently "20" for HTTP-based links and "21" for HTTPS-based links). See <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tco-url-wrapper/how-twitter-wrap-urls">How Twitter wraps URLs with t.co</a> for more information on how t.co plays a role in character counting. <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/counting-characters">Counting Characters</a> provides more details on character counting strategies. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="7447">
  How do I obtain an API key?  </h3>  <p> You can create an application record (which includes an API key) by navigating to  <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/apps">Application Management</a>.</p>
<p>Most integrations with the API will require you to identify your application to Twitter by way of an API key. On the Twitter platform, the term "API key" usually refers to what's called an OAuth consumer key. This string identifies your application when making requests to the API. In <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/oauth">OAuth 1.0a</a>, your "API keys" might refer to the combination of this consumer key and the "consumer secret," a string that used to securely "sign" your requests to Twitter. Most requests to Twitter require a user context in addition to the application context. User context is presented through the use of another kind of token/key called the "access token." See <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/obtaining-access-tokens">Obtaining access tokens</a> for more information. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="6977">
  How do I properly navigate a timeline?  </h3>  <p> The <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/working-with-timelines">Working with Timelines</a> document describes the optimal way to obtain tweets from timelines such as <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/home_timeline">GET statuses/home_timeline</a>, <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/mentions">GET statuses/mentions</a> and <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/user_timeline">GET statuses/user_timeline</a>.</p>
<p>The "count" parameter behaves more closely in concept to an "up to" parameter in that you'll receive up to the number specified in the parameter. You cannot be guaranteed that you'll receive the total amount you've requested, even if the timeline contains at least that many accessible tweets. Parameters such as <span class="geshifilter"><code class="java geshifilter-java">include_retweets<span class="sy0">=</span><span class="kw2">true</span></code></span> and <span class="geshifilter"><code class="java geshifilter-java">exclude_replies<span class="sy0">=</span><span class="kw2">true</span></code></span> effect the number of results timeline methods will yield per request.</p>
<p>There are no explicit methods to walk timelines by date or time. Use <span class="geshifilter"><code class="java geshifilter-java">since_id</code></span> and <span class="geshifilter"><code class="java geshifilter-java">max_id</code></span> to consume a timeline linearly. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="6974">
  How do I use the REST API over JSON-P?  </h3>  <p> The REST API supports a callback parameter on nearly all methods. See <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/things-every-developer-should-know#jsonp">Things Every Developer Should Know</a> for more information. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="5809">
  How do I use the Twitter platform?  </h3>  <p> Twitter offers a platform with a number of different ways to interact with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/intents">Web Intents</a>, <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tweet-button">Tweet Button</a> and <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/follow-button">Follow Button</a> is the simplest way to bring basic Twitter functionality to your site. It provides features like the ability to tweet, retweet, or follow using basic HTML and Javascript. You can also <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-tweets">embed individual tweets</a>.</p>
<p>More complex integrations can utilize our <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api">REST</a>, <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/using-search">Search</a>, and <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis">Streaming</a> APIs. The Streaming API allows you to stream tweets in real time as they happen. The Search API provides relevant results to ad-hoc user queries from a limited corpus of recent tweets. The REST API allows access to the nouns and verbs of Twitter such as reading timelines, tweeting, and following.</p>
<p>To use the REST and Streaming API, you should register an application and get to know the ways of <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/oauth">OAuth</a> and explore <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/twitter-libraries">Twitter Libraries</a>. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="5811">
  What is the version of the REST API?  </h3>  <p> There are currently two active versions of the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api">Twitter REST API</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1">REST API version 1.1</a> is the most recent version of the API. To unifying versioning across the platform, version 1.1 also encompasses the Search and Streaming APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1">REST API version 1</a> is now deprecated and will cease functioning in March 2013. Move to version 1.1 as soon as possible. The concept of "version 1" of the API includes unversioned APIs like the Search API. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="7668">
  What kind of data can I get from the API?  </h3>  <p> To explore the kind of data available to you in the API, browse the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api">available resources</a> and this <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects">field guide</a> to the most commonly accessed platform objects. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="7917">
  What kind of data does the Twitter Platform capture?  </h3>  <p> Like many companies, Twitter receives log data from visits to websites that use our social widgets, such as our Tweet and Follow buttons. This log data may include information such as IP address, browser type, the referring web page, pages visited, cookies, and other interactions with the buttons or widgets as outlined in our privacy policy: <a href="https://twitter.com/privacy" title="https://twitter.com/privacy" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/privacy</a> </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="5808">
  What&#039;s an API?  </h3>  <p> The acronym "API" stands for "Application Programming Interface". An API is a defined way for a program to accomplish a task, usually by retrieving or modifying data. In Twitter's case, we provide an API method for just about every feature you can see on our website. Programmers use the Twitter API to make applications, websites, widgets, and other projects that interact with Twitter. Programs talk to the Twitter API over HTTP, the same protocol that your browser uses to visit and interact with web pages. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="6536">
  What&#039;s the difference between User Streams and Site Streams?  </h3>  <p> <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis/streams/user">User streams</a> provides a way for a single user to be streamed the equivalent of their home timeline (the tweets authored by the users they follow) and mentions timeline (the tweets authored by users @<a href="http://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=mentioning">mentioning</a> that user). It also offers the ability to be streamed DMs received by the user when permissioned. In addition to those data points, events like other users favoriting or retweeting that user's tweets, users following that user (or that user following other users), and so on.</p>
<p>Think of it as a "me feed" -- everything about Twitter the service as it relates to "me" the account holder. TweetDeck, Twitter for Mac, and Tweetbot for iPad all use User Streams to stream these tweets and related events about a single user in real-time.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis/streams/site">Site streams</a> is an expansion of this concept for services that want to stream the equivalent of this "me feed" on behalf of many users at a time. This makes Site Streams appropriate for web sites and services that act on behalf of many mutual users in a centralized fashion. User Streams is more appropriate for a single-user client-side application or a very limited server scenario while developing a bot that responds to DMs, for example.</p>
<p>User Streams also allows a user to track a limited amount of real-time "searches" on public tweets, mixed in with the "me feed." Site Streams does not offer this ability directly. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="6981">
  Why are embedded objects stale or inaccurate?  </h3>  <p> It's best to go to the primary resource for a definitive "answer" about something. Information about tweets should come from methods in the statuses namespace. Information about users from the users namespace. Information about following relationships in the friends/followings/followers/friendships namespaces and so on.</p>
<p>When calling a method without authentication, there is no user context/agency to determine whether the "current user" is following the user embedded within the status. In those cases the typically boolean field is neither true nor false, but null.</p>
<p>The Twitter API has been around for awhile now. We're still on version 1, but we've got to make up for decisions made years ago while maintaining overall compatibility. One early decision made on the API was to include what's called perspectival attributes embedded within a child object of an unlike parent object. For example, tweets are the parent object, users are the child object, and whether the current user making the request is following that child user object or not is the perspectival "following" attribute. As the service has grown, these kind of inner values have become harder to maintain at scale.</p>
<p>When you make the request using authentication, we make a best effort to return to you a accurate, up to date, and perspectivally-contextual response, starting with the primary object in the highest priority and diminishing from there. If we can't determine the following status in a timely fashion (due to having to make rapid calculations while serving the caller the object), we'll respond with "null" rater than "true" or "false" because the status is indeterminate. </p></blockquote></div><div class="category">
  <h2 id="authentication-rate-limiting">Authentication &amp; Rate Limiting</h2><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="7188">
  Do Twitter&#039;s OAuth 1.0A access tokens expire?  </h3>  <p> The access tokens yielded to your through the OAuth process do not have an explicit expiration datetime attached to them. They will be valid for use when making requests on behalf of your users for as long as the user has granted your application access. A user can revoke access to your application at any time.</p>
<p>Please note that the strings representing access tokens are not static -- if a user revokes your application or otherwise transits from one permission level to another (such as from read-only to read-write), the strings will be altered. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="6861">
  How are rate limits determined on the Streaming API?  </h3>  <p> The public streaming APIs cap the number of messages sent to your client to a small fraction of the total volume of Tweets at any given moment.</p>
<p>The sample hose, as documented in <a href="https://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/sample.json" title="https://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/sample.json" rel="nofollow">https://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/sample.json</a>, delivers a random sampling of all Tweets at a volume equal to the public streaming cap.</p>
<p>Filtered streams return all matching Tweets up to a volume equal to the streaming cap.  If there are more tweets that would match your criteria, you'll be streamed a rate limit message indicating how many tweets were not delivered. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="7189">
  How do I get access tokens from my iOS native Twitter application to my server?  </h3>  <p> <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/ios/using-reverse-auth">Using Reverse Auth</a> is a method of converting the access representations available in the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/ios">Integrating with Twitter on iOS</a>. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="5823">
  How do I keep from running into the rate limit?  </h3>  <ul>
<li>Caching. We recommend that you cache API responses in your application or on your site if you expect high-volume usage. For example, don't try to call the Twitter API on every page load of your hugely popular website. Instead, call our API once a minute and save the response to your local server, displaying your cached version on your site. Refer to the Terms of Service for specific information about caching limitations.</li>
<li>Rate limiting by active user. If your site keeps track of many Twitter users (for example, fetching their current status or statistics about their Twitter usage), please consider only requesting data for users who have recently signed in to your site.</li>
<li>Scale your use of the API with the number of users you have. When using OAuth to authenticate requests with the API, the rate limit applied is specific to that user_token. This means, every user who authorizes your application to act on their behalf, has their own bucket of API requests for you to use.</li>
<li>Request only what you need, and only when you need it. For example, polling the REST API looking for new data is inefficient for both your application, and the Twitter API. Instead consider using one of the Streaming APIs as a signal of when to make REST API requests.</li>
<li>Consider using a combination of the APIs to achieve your goal. You can't do everything with one API, but by combining them you can do most things. For example, instead of using the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/search">Search API</a> for all your querying, use the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis">Streaming API</a> to track keywords and follow users Tweets, and save the Search API for the more complex queries.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some example strategies. To work out different solutions for you to achieve your goals, search through <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/discussions">discussions</a> on the topic or start your own. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="6718">
  How do I obtain a user&#039;s email address?  </h3>  <p> If you'd like a user's email address, you'll need to ask a user for it within the confines of your own application and service. The Twitter API does not provide the user's email address as part of the OAuth token negotiation process nor does it offer other means to obtain it. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="6461">
  How do password resets effect application authorization?  </h3>  <p> When using OAuth, application connectivity and permissions do not change when a user resets their password on twitter.com. The relationship between Twitter, a user, and a third-party application do not involve a username and password combination. When a Twitter user changes their password, we'll now ask the user whether they would also like to revoke any of their application authorizations, but any revocations are manually executed by the end user.</p>
<p>As of March 12, 2012 it is still possible to connect to the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis">The Streaming APIs</a> via Basic Auth credentials. If the password belonging to a user account that connects to  the Streaming API via basic auth is changed, the new password will need to be used to regain that connection. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="6868">
  How long do I have to wait when requesting xAuth?  </h3>  <p> Most xAuth requests will be processed within 72 business day hours though there are times of increased demand which can extend this duration. Plan accordingly and be sure that your initial request for xAuth access contains everything an API Policy Team member would need to confirm the legitimacy of the request and your readiness for the feature. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="6865">
  I don&#039;t want to require users to authenticate but 150 requests per hour is not enough for my app, what should I do?  </h3>  <p> Rethink not wanting to require authentication. It's the primary means to grow your application's capabilities. We recommend requiring authentication to make use of potentially 350 requests per hour per access token/user. Consider also investigating whether the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis/parameters#follow">Streaming API&#039;s follow filter</a> will work for you. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="6466">
  I set my app to &quot;read, write, and direct messages&quot; but it still won&#039;t let me read my direct messages; why?  </h3>  <p> Permissions set at the application level are effective only for access tokens generated after the requested permission level is set. If you generated an access token while the permission level was still set to read-only or just read &amp; write, you'll need to renegotiate the access token through the OAuth flow for the access token to hold the upgraded permissions.</p>
<p>Changes to permission settings can take a few minutes to apply. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="6460">
  What consequences are there to resetting my consumer key and secret?  </h3>  <p> If your consumer key and secret become compromised for any reason, you may need to reset it to regain secure control of your application's identity and the actions taken in its name. Resetting your consumer key does not reset the strings representing your users (their "access tokens") but does make your access tokens invalid when used with the former key. When your existent access tokens are used with your new consumer key and secret, they will continue functioning as expected. Your new consumer key and secret will be represented by completely different strings than its previous incarnation. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="6869">
  What&#039;s a placeholder URL? How do I set my callback URL?  </h3>  <p> In OAuth 1.0a, you're required to send an explicit oauth_callback value on every request to <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/oauth/request_token">POST oauth/request_token</a>, regardless of any pre-registered callback you may have associated with your application or if you're going to be performing out-of-band OAuth (for which you'd provide an <span class="geshifilter"><code class="java geshifilter-java">oauth_callback<span class="sy0">=</span>oob</code></span> value).</p>
<p>When you create or edit your application on dev.twitter.com, you need to choose which kind of OAuth authentication you'll be using: standard callback-based OAuth, out-of-band mode OAuth (also known as "PIN-code OAuth" &amp; "OOB OAuth"), or xAuth.</p>
<p>If you're exclusively using out-of-band OAuth or xAuth, you want to leave the "Callback URL" field empty. By doing so, your application will not allow for callback-based OAuth to be performed.</p>
<p>If you'll be using callback-based OAuth, you want to provide the "Callback URL" field with a fully qualified "placeholder" URL. This URL does not have to be the actual oauth_callback value you'll send on oauth/request_token, but it does need to represent a HTTP or HTTPS-based URL with a TLD we recognize. If you know you'll be performing callback-based OAuth, consider just providing a URL to your home page.</p>
<p>You can provide non-standard URI types to oauth/request_token with a dynamic oauth_callback parameter but cannot use such schemes on your application record. </p></blockquote></div><div class="category">

  Why do Tweets starting with D or M return a valid API response but not show up in my timeline?  </h3>  <p> As described in <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/14020">Official Twitter Text Commands</a>, Twitter's SMS interface allows for sending direct messages by using either of these formats:</p>

</div>
<p>These are valid anywhere you can issue a Tweet - try sending a DM through the Tweet box on twitter.com, for example.

  Is my IP banned or blacklisted?  </h3>  <p> Being banned or blacklisted means the Twitter APIs will not respond to requests you make to them. You know if you have been blacklisted because the APIs will not respond to you at all. If this happens to you the first thing to do is stop any requests your application is making. Then see if you can reach other URLs using a command line tool like curl. If you can access other URLs but not Twitter, you should login to Twitter.com and then file a ticket with our support team. The support team will then be in contact about next steps.</p>
<p>Twitter provides APIs for free and with no guarantees of service availability. This means we may take steps to ban or block any account, IP, or range of IPs that might be harming our ability to provide Twitter in a timely and reliable way.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid being blacklisted is to pay attention to the remaining API requests you are allowed to make, and to handle errors appropriately. Handling errors appropriately means reducing your request frequency (throttling) or stopping requests until you can identify why the request failed.</p>
<p>If you have sufficiently diagnosed your network connectivity and believe your IP may have been blacklisted, please post to the discussion forums.. Provide as much detail as possible about which steps you've taken to diagnose. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="5819">

  What am I doing wrong?  </h3>  <p> Troubleshooting with the API is usually done with these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Examine the HTTP response closely: the status code you received back, the message that accompanies that code, the HTTP headers in the response, and the response body itself -- the response body usually contains the most specific information about the nature of an error. </li>
<li>If you're using OAuth but the response doesn't seem like what you're expecting, look for an X-Warning HTTP header that informs you that your OAuth is invalid. We will often service invalid requests as if OAuth were not sent at all rather than rejecting it.</li>
<li>Consult <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/discussions/204">Troubleshooting OAuth 1.0A</a> for tips on troubleshooting OAuth problems.</li>
<li>If the response body doesn't help identify the problem, check @<a href="http://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=twitterapi">twitterapi</a> and <a href="https://status.twitter.com" title="https://status.twitter.com" rel="nofollow">https://status.twitter.com</a> or <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/status">API Status</a>  to see if there are any known issues with the API at that time.</li>
<li>If you are using your own library, try using another library or curl to see if the same issue occurs. You can find libraries for many programming languages on our <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/twitter-libraries">Twitter Libraries</a> page.</li>
<li>If you are still seeing problems send a message <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/discussions">Discussions</a> where Twitter Employees and Community Developers can try and help you. Make sure you include the language you are using, the request that's failing and the response (including headers) that you get back. The more information you provide in the email the quicker somebody can help you out.</li>

  Why am I getting a HTTP 404 for my timeline feed?  </h3>  <p> If you're requesting a timeline URL that used to work but now does not, you are likely using an outdated URL that has been retired.

  Why are the Tweets I&#039;m looking for not in Twitter Search, the Search API, or Search widgets?  </h3>  <p> Twitter's <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/using-search">search</a> is optimized to serve relevant tweets to end-users in response to direct, non-recurring queries such as #hashtags, URLs, domains, and keywords. The Search API (which also powers Twitter's search widget) is an interface to this search engine. Our search service is not meant to be an exhaustive archive of public tweets and not all tweets are indexed or returned. Some results are refined to better combat spam and increase relevance. Due to capacity constraints, the index currently only covers about a week's worth of tweets.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/user_timeline">user timeline</a> API is the definitive source of tweets by a specific author. For a collection of recent Tweets by more than one user, consider creating a Twitter List and leveraging the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/lists/statuses">list timeline</a>. <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis">The Streaming API</a> is often the best-fit choice when seeking completeness.</p>

  How should we handle @usernames?  </h3>  <p> When cross-posting to Twitter with @<a href="http://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=usernames">usernames</a>, be sure to accurately map to the user the author intended to @<a href="http://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=mention">mention</a>. If your service binds users' Twitter accounts with its own concept of a user profiles, then you can use these relationships to help cross-post @<a href="http://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=usernames">usernames</a> accurately. In cases where these relationships don't exist or your application can't map to the correct Twitter user, we recommend cross-posting with either users' real names or their username without the "@" symbol pre-fixed. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="10668">

  I&#039;m not a developer, how do I render tweets according to display requirements?  </h3>  <p> You can review our <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-requirements">Developer Display Requirements</a>. <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-tweets">Embedded Tweets</a> and <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-timelines">Embedded Timelines</a> are easy ways to implement display requirements. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="10665">
  In API v1.1 will developers be allowed include additional actions on Tweets such as &quot;Send to Instagram,&quot; &quot;Send Email,&quot; &quot;Tweet of the Day?&quot;  </h3>  <p> No. Please leave the integrity of the Tweet intact. If you feel compelled to add additional content, please do so around or adjacent to the Tweet, but not within the actual Tweet itself. If you’re concerned about staying inline with our <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-requirements">Developer Display Requirements</a>, please see our <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-tweets">Embedded Tweets</a> and <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-timelines">Embedded Timelines</a> products. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="10651">
  Is there any token limit for non-client applications?  </h3>  <p> If you think you’re going to need more than 1 million tokens, please plan to come and talk with us as you approach that number. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="10645">
  What happens to the widgets that are based on the Search API and API version 1.0?  </h3>  <p> They will be deprecated when version 1 is closed. We recommend using the new <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-timelines">Embedded Timelines</a> instead. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="10648">
  What output formats will API v1.1 support?  </h3>  <p> API v1.1 will support JSON only. We’ve been hinting at this for some time now, first dropping XML support on the Streaming API and more recently on the trends API.  XML, Atom, and RSS are infrequently used today, and we’ve chosen to throw our support behind the JSON format shared across the platform. Consequently, we’ve decided to discontinue support for these other formats. For historical context, when we originally built the API all major languages did not have performant, well vetted libraries supporting JSON - today they do. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="10647">
  When will API 1.0 be retired?  </h3>  <p> We will begin to temporarily turn off the endpoints for API v1.0 starting March 5th, 2013 for a series of "blackout tests". See <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/planning-for-api-v1-retirement">Planning for API v1’s Retirement</a> for more information. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="10657">
  Will an application have to request user authorization just to make public API calls?  </h3>  <p> When API v1.1 is released, user authorization (and access tokens) are required for all API 1.1 requests. In the weeks following release, some methods will require only application-based authentication for certain "userless" contexts. </p></blockquote><blockquote class="node-embed">  <h3 id="10659">
