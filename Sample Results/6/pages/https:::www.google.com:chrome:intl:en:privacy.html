          <p>
            Last modified: October 18, 2012 (<a href="privacy_archive.html">view archived
            versions</a>)
          </p>
          <p>
            The <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a>
            describes how we treat personal information when you use Google's products and
            services, including when you use Chrome browser and Chrome OS to access those products
            and services.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Google Chrome Privacy Notice describes the privacy practices that are specific to
            the Chrome family of products. This includes the Chrome browser, Chrome Frame, Chrome
            OS, and Safe Browsing. Some of the features described in this Privacy Notice are
            available in other web browsers (e.g. you may choose to run Chrome Frame in Microsoft
            Internet Explorer or use Safe Browsing features in Mozilla Firefox), so remember that
            you should also read the privacy policy for the browser in which the features are
            running.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not all of the features discussed in this Privacy Notice appear in all Chrome products.
            To keep things simple, however, we’re going to use the term “Chrome” on its own to
            refer to each of the products within the Chrome family -- including Chrome browser,
            Chrome Frame, and Chrome OS. Where an individual Chrome product works in a different
            way we’ll be sure to highlight that.
          </p>
          <p>
            For early adopters who want to test features that are still under development, we make
            available <a href="http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel">preview
            versions</a> (also known as beta, dev, and canary) of Chrome browser and Chrome OS in
            addition to the stable version. Although this Google Chrome Privacy Notice applies to
            the stable and preview versions, it may not be fully up to date when describing
            features still under development in the preview versions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google will notify you of any material changes to this policy, and you will always have
            the option to use Chrome in a way that does not send any personally identifiable
            information to Google, or to remove your information and discontinue using it.
          </p>
          <p>
            For step-by-step guides to help manage your privacy preferences read our guide to
            <a href="more/privacy.html">Browsers, Google Chrome, Privacy and You</a>
          </p>
          <h2 class="small">
            Information Google receives when you use Chrome
          </h2>
          <p>
            You do not need to provide any personally identifying information in order to use
            Chrome.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you use any browser, including Chrome, to contact Google’s servers, by default
            Google receives <a href=
            "http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-server-logs">standard
            log information</a> including your system’s IP address and one or more <a href=
            "http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-cookie">cookies</a>.
            You can configure Chrome browser and Chrome OS to not accept cookies from Google or
            other sites. Learn more about <a href=
            "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_cookies">configuring cookies and site
            data</a> in Chrome browser and Chrome OS.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you use Chrome to access other Google services, such as using the search engine on
            the Google homepage or checking Gmail, the fact that you are using Chrome does not
            cause Google to receive any special or additional personally identifying information
            about you.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, some Chrome features may send limited additional information to Google or
            your default search engine:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you use the <a href=
            "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_multi_users">Multiple Users feature</a> of
            Chrome browser, you can set up personalized copies of Chrome browser for users who are
            sharing the same computing device. It isn’t intended to secure your data against other
            people using your device - so anyone with access to your device can view all the
            information in all profiles. To truly protect your data from being seen by others, use
            the built-in user accounts in your operating system.
            </li>
            <li>If you choose Google as your search engine, Chrome will contact Google when it
            starts or when you change networks so as to determine the best local web address to
            send search queries. When you type URLs or queries in the Chrome address bar (omnibox),
            the letters you type may be sent to your default search engine, so that the search
            engine’s prediction feature can automatically recommend terms or URLs you may be
            looking for. If you accept a predicted query or URL, Chrome may send that information
            from the browser to your default search engine as well. Learn more about <a href=
            "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_predictions">disabling server predictions in
            the omnibox</a>.
            </li>
            <li>If you use <a href=
            "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_chrome_instant">Chrome’s Instant feature</a>
            and it is supported by your <a href=
            "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_search_engine">default search engine</a>,
            search results and in-line predictions appear instantly as you type in the address bar.
            Search results are requested as you type in the address bar, so the text you type may
            be logged as search terms. For some helpful examples of Google’s logging policies for
            Chrome Instant, <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_logging_policy">see
            our “Logging Policies for Chrome Instant” help center article</a>.
            </li>
            <li>If you navigate to a URL that does not exist, Chrome may send the URL to Google so
            we can help you find the URL you were looking for. We may also use this information in
            an aggregated way to help other web users - e.g. to let them know that the site may be
            down. Learn more about disabling <a href=
            "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_nav_errors">suggestions on navigation
            errors</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Chrome periodically contacts Google to perform functions such as checking for
            updates, checking connectivity status, validating current time, and estimating the
            number of active users. Each copy of Chrome browser includes a temporary
            randomly-generated installation number which will be sent to Google when you install
            and first use the product. The temporary number will be promptly deleted the first time
            that Chrome automatically checks for updates. If you received or reactivated your copy
            of the Chrome browser as part of a promotional campaign, it may also generate a
            non-unique promotional tag which is sent to Google when performing searches with Google
            and a unique token which is sent to Google when you first run and use the browser after
            installation, reinstallation, or reactivation. Furthermore, <a href=
            "http://blog.chromium.org/2012/05/changes-to-field-trials-infrastructure.html">field
            trials</a> may result in different variations of Chrome, and Chrome may send non-unique
            information to Google about which variation is active.
            </li>
            <li>Chrome OS contacts Google’s enterprise servers during initial device setup to
            determine if the device is subject to policies of an enterprise admin. This process
            involves sending part of a hash of the device's serial number to Google's enterprise
            servers and receiving back a list of hashed device serial numbers for devices
            configured by enterprise admins to be enterprise devices. Chrome OS also contacts
            Google’s enterprise servers each time a user signs in with a username that does not end
            with @gmail.com or @googlemail.com to determine if the user account is subject to
            policies of an enterprise admin. For devices and user accounts subject to enterprise
            policies, Chrome OS will check periodically for updates to these policies. Enterprise
            policies may involve status and activity reporting, including location information, set
            up by the enterprise admin.
            </li>
            <li>If you sign in to Chrome browser or Chrome OS with your Google Account, this will
            enable the synchronization feature. Google will store certain information, such as
            bookmarks, history and other settings, on Google's servers in association with your
            <a href="http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?answer=27439">Google
            Account</a>. Information stored with your Account is protected by the <a href=
            "http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a>. We need to store
            this information in order to make it available to you on other instances of Chrome in
            which you choose to sign in. Learn more about the <a href=
            "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_signin">specific information</a> you may
            select to synchronize, and more about <a href=
            "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_signin">disabling Chrome’s synchronization
            feature</a> in Chrome browser.
            </li>
            <li>If you sign into Chrome OS with your Google Account or enable offline use of a
            Google application in Chrome browser, Chrome may contact Google’s servers and
            synchronize your data with a local copy to enable offline functionality.
            </li>
            <li>If you use the Translate feature of Chrome, it will send the text you choose to be
            translated to Google for translation.
            </li>
            <li>If you use the Spellcheck feature of Chrome, which lets you use the same technology
            used in Google search to check your spelling, it will send the text you type to Google
            for spelling and grammar suggestions.
            </li>
            <li>If you use the speech input feature of Chrome, it will send Google an audio
            recording of your spoken query, your default browser language and the grammar settings
            of the web page for which you are using speech input. Google will use this information
            to convert the recorded audio into text. If you have enabled usage statistics and crash
            reports and you use the speech input feature, additional information will be sent to
            Google. This information includes the URL of the website using speech input, your
            operating system, and the manufacturer and model of the computing device and audio
            hardware you are using.
            </li>
            <li>If you use Chrome’s AutoFill feature, which automatically completes web forms for
            you based on similar forms you have filled out before, Chrome will send Google limited
            information about the pages that have web forms, including a hashed URL of the web page
            and details of the form's structure, so that we can improve our AutoFill service for
            this web form. While the information that Chrome sends may include the fact that you
            typed information into the form, the actual text that you type in the fields will not
            be sent to Google unless you choose to store that data in your Google Account using
            Chrome’s synchronization feature.
            </li>
            <li>If you use Chrome’s location feature, which allows you to share your location with
            a web site, Chrome will send local network information to Google Location Services to

            Information Google receives when you use the Safe Browsing feature on Chrome or other
            browsers
          </h2>
          <p>
            Google Chrome and certain third party browsers (including some versions of Mozilla’s
            Firefox and Apple’s Safari) includes Google's Safe Browsing feature. Safe Browsing
            sends and receives information between the browser you are using and Google's servers
            about suspicious websites -- for example when you visit a site that is suspected to be
            a phishing or malware site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your browser will contact Google’s servers periodically to download the most recent
            “Safe Browsing” list, containing known phishing and malware sites. Google does not
            collect any account information or other personally identifying information as part of
            this contact, but it does receive standard log information, including an IP address and
            one or more cookies. The most recent copy of the list is stored locally on your system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each site you visit will be checked against the Safe Browsing list on your system. If
            there is a match against the list, your browser will send Google a hashed, partial copy
            of the site’s URL so that Google can send more information to your browser. Google
            cannot determine the real URL from this information. Read more <a href=
            "http://code.google.com/apis/safebrowsing/firefox3_privacy_faq.html">information about
            how this works</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the following Safe Browsing features are specific to Chrome:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Some versions of Chrome feature Safe Browsing technology that can identify
            potentially harmful sites and executable file downloads not already known by Google.
            Information regarding a potentially harmful site or executable file download (including
            the full URL of the site or executable file download) may be sent to Google to help
            determine whether the site or download is harmful. Google does not collect any account
            information or other personally identifying information as part of this contact, but
            does receive standard log information, including an IP address, URL visited and one or
            more cookies.
            </li>
            <li>You can choose to send additional data to help improve Safe Browsing when you
            access a site that appears to contain malware. This data is sent when you close or
            navigate away from a Safe Browsing warning page. The reports contain data, such as the
            URL and contents of the website as well as the URL of the page that directed you to
            that site, that can be used by Google to verify whether the site is still serving
            content that may exploit users.
            </li>
            <li>If usage statistics are enabled in Chrome and you visit a site that we think could
            be potentially harmful, certain additional data will be shared with Google, including
            the full URL that you visited, the “referer” header sent to that page, and the URL that
            matched the Safe Browsing list.
            </li>
            <li>You can always choose to <a href=
            "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_safe_browsing">disable the Safe Browsing
            feature</a> within Chrome.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="small">
            Information website operators receive when you visit a site using Chrome
          </h2>
          <p>
            Sites that you visit using Chrome will automatically receive <a href=
            "http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-server-logs">standard
            log information</a> similar to that received by Google. These sites may also set their
            own <a href=
            "http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-cookie">cookies</a>
            or store site data on your system. You can restrict cookies and other site data in
            Chrome's preferences page.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you enable Chrome’s network actions prediction feature and you visit a webpage,
            Chrome may look up the IP addresses of all links on the webpage and open network
            connections to load webpages faster. Sites can also use <a href=
            "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_prerender">pre-rendering</a> technology to
            pre-load the links that you might click next.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you use Chrome in incognito mode (or in guest mode on Chrome OS), it will not
            transmit any pre-existing cookies to sites that you visit. Sites may deposit new
            cookies on your system while you are in these modes; these cookies will only be
            temporarily stored and transmitted to sites while you remain in incognito / guest mode.
            They will be deleted when you close the browser, close all open incognito windows or
            exit guest mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you choose to use Chrome’s location feature, this service allows you to share your
            location with a site. Chrome will not allow a site to access your location without your
            permission. Google does not have control over third party websites or their privacy
            practices. Please carefully consider any website’s privacy practices before consenting
            to share your location with that website.
          </p>

            Information stored on your system when you use Chrome
          </h2>
          <p>
            Chrome stores some information locally on your system. This may include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Basic browsing history information, for example the URLs of pages that you visit, a
            cache file of text and images from those pages, and a list of some IP addresses
              <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_prerender">linked from</a> pages
              that you visit.
            </li>
            <li>A searchable index of most pages you visit (except for secure pages with "https"
            web addresses, such as some bank pages)
            </li>
            <li>Thumbnail-sized screenshots of most pages you visit
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href=
              "http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-cookie">Cookies</a>
              or web storage data deposited on your system by websites you visit
            </li>
            <li>Locally-stored data saved by Add-ons
            </li>
            <li>A record of downloads you have made from websites
            </li>
            <li>A unique device identifier generated by Chrome OS which may be required by third
            party services for access to their content. You can disable this feature in the Chrome
            OS settings.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can always choose to <a href=
            "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_delete_history">delete your browsing history
            information</a>, in whole or in part.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also limit the information Chrome stores on your system by using <a href=
            "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_incognito">incognito mode</a> (or guest mode
            on Chrome OS). In these modes, Chrome will not store basic browsing history information
            such as URLs, cached page text, or IP addresses of pages linked from the websites you
            visit. It will also not store snapshots of pages that you visit or keep a record of
            your downloads (although this information could still be stored elsewhere on your
            system, e.g. in a list of recently opened files). New cookies received in these modes
            will not be saved after you close your browser, close all open incognito windows or
            exit guest mode. You can see when you are in incognito / guest mode because the
            incognito icon appears in the top corner of your browser; in some cases the border of
            your browser window may also change color.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you make changes to your browser configuration, such as by bookmarking a web page
            or changing your settings, this information is also saved. These changes are not
            affected by incognito / guest mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can choose to have Chrome save your passwords for specific websites. Stored
            passwords can be <a href=
            "https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=cpn_passwords">reviewed</a> in the Personal Stuff
            tab of the Chrome preferences page.

          <h2 class="small">
            Using apps, extensions, themes, services, and other add-ons with Chrome
          </h2>
          <p>
            You may use apps, extensions, themes, services and other add-ons (“Add-ons”) with
            Chrome, including some that may be pre-installed or integrated with Chrome and some
            that you may obtain from <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web
            Store</a> or other sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before installing an Add-on, you should review the requested permissions. Add-ons may
            be designed to store, access, and share locally-stored data. Add-ons may use
            notifications that are sent through Google servers. Chrome may check for, download, and
            install updates to your Add-ons. Chrome may send usage indicators to Google for
            installed Add-ons.
          </p>
          <p>
            From time to time, Google may discover an Add-on that violates the developer terms for
            Chrome Web Store or other legal agreements, laws, regulations or policies. Chrome may
            periodically download a list of such Add-ons from Google’s servers, and Google may
            remotely disable or remove such Add-ons from user systems in its sole discretion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Add-ons developed and provided by Google may communicate with Google servers and are
            subject to the Google Privacy Policy unless otherwise indicated. Add-ons developed and
            provided by third parties are the responsibility of such third parties and may be
            subject to third party privacy policies. For example, a version of the Adobe Flash
            Player plug-in is preinstalled with Chrome. Adobe’s website at www.adobe.com provides
            more information on Adobe’s privacy practices with regard to Flash Player, and you can
