<h1>Cognizor welcome</h1>

</p><div style="padding-left: 210pt">

<p></p>

<p>
<em>Cognize:</em>  to think and act in concert.  (Compare 'recognize', and then 'cognition'.) <br>
To do this, individuals (and perhaps co-ordinated groups of individuals, like orchestras) <br>
pull on <u>instinct</u> and <u>reflexes</u>.  They pull in <u>sensations</u> and <u>perceptions</u>.  We also use <u>memory</u> <br>
and <u>reasoning</u> so we can do what we mean to do.  <br>
</p><div style="padding-left: 30pt">
Perhaps that requires life, and perhaps intention?  <br>
</div>
<p></p>
	
<p>
</p><div style="padding-left: 30pt">
How does it all work, so as to let us think and act in a coherent way?<br>
</div>
<p></p>

<p>
Appreciating the nature of cognition and its existence â€” that's what Cognizor is all about. <br>
</p>
 
<p>
If you too appreciate and are curious about cognition, you are especially welcome!<br>
</p>

<p>
For instance, Cognizor is looking into:<br>
</p>

<p>
</p><ul style="padding-left: 30pt">
<li>how people communicate in daily life</li>
<ul>
<li>Why do you decide to tell someone something?</li>
<li>How do you do it?</li>
<li>How do you know they got it?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>
</p><ul style="padding-left: 30pt">
<li>how music carries significance</li>
<ul>
<li>What is non-verbal meaning?</li>
<li>How do the properties of a musical instrument relate to its making meaningful sound?</li>
<li>Why does music "pull at the heartstrings" and delve into memory?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
Cognizor's projects use research techniques to pull together understanding of such matters.<br>
<p></p>
