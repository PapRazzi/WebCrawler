    <h1>C-- News for October, 2001</h1>

    <p>(There is <a href="2001.05.html">old news</a> from earlier this year
    still available.)</p>

    <p>Basile Starynkevitch has asked us on the <a href='../mail.html'>C--
            mailing list</a>     where <a href='../qc--.html'>Quick C--</a>     is heading. Good question. Here is <a href='../people.html'>Norman's</a>     answer:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <i>I am quite impressed by the ongoing work on QuickC--. But
      I did not have the time to study it with big care.</i> 

      <p><i>I also have the impression that this mailing list is
      really silent...</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    We are too busy working on the compiler :-) 

    <blockquote>
      <i>What are the first (real machine) targets of QC--?</i> 

      <p><i>It seems to me that the first target are Sparcs. Why
      not x86 under Linux? I understand that compiling to x86 might
      be a bit more difficult than compiling to Sparc (because
      Sparc is more RISC-y and, most importantly, more orthogonal
      ISA than x86) but I naively believe that x86 is a more common
      target (i.e. a much bigger market).</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    We want to knock off sparc, x86, and probably alpha and arm in
    fairly short order. We're starting with sparc primarily because
    the instruction set is simpler and therefore the
    not-ready-for-prime-time tools we're using to manage the
    instruction set have an easier time. We are also concerned
    about the that x86 register-allocation constraints may be hard
    to deal with. 

    <blockquote>
      <i>Why is a Lua interpreter included in QC--?</i> 

      <p><i>I understand quite well the usefulness of a
      [Turing-complete] scripting language in an application, at
      least in the development phase. However, I have no idea why a
      scripting language would be useful in a mature C--
      compiler!</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    It's not a mature compiler---it's an experimental compiler. We
    want to be able to reconfigure the compiler on the command line
    and to describe calling conventions in source code. 

    <blockquote>
      <i>But I cannot see why Ocaml is not used as a scripting
      language (I know that bytecode [compiled with ocamlc] and
      machinecode [compiled with ocamlopt] Ocaml are not mixable,
      but I would believe that for testing and debugging purpose an
      Ocaml-bytecode C-- compiler would be enough, ie that Lua is
      not really useful, but we could have a custom Ocaml
      interpreter containing all QC-- code).</i>
    </blockquote>
    The technology we would need to make this work is beyond us. A
    Lua interpreter is quite simple and is sufficient for our
    needs. 

    <blockquote>
      <i>How should I run QC-- on some example to see actual
      generated assembly code (in Sparc, or preferably x86 when it
      would happen).</i>
    </blockquote>
    For the moment, 
<pre>
  
  qc-- -c foo.c--
</pre>
    will do something moderately interesting. In the long run,
    something like 
<pre>
  qc-- -target=x86/linux -S foo.c--
</pre>
    is likely to be the eventual interface. 

    <blockquote>
      <i>What are the medium term roadmap of QC--? What about
      targetting x86 and PIC (position independent code) for shared
      library?</i>
    </blockquote>

    <ol>
      <li>Emit proper assembly language</li>

      <li>Get it to run on parameterless procedures</li>

      <li>Support sensible calling conventions</li>

      <li>Support C calling conventions</li>

      <li>Get a real code generator</li>

      <li>Start work on the run-time system</li>

      <li>Get some front ends</li>
    </ol>
    We're trying to make multiple targets and PIC easy.
