<b>Algol60</b><ul>
	I think, this is the original
	<a href="languages/Algol60-Naur.pdf">
	Peter Naur edition</a>
	of the Algol 60 report. I remember the typewriter and a
	second part, which describes the Algol system for the Danish
	GIER machine, also written by Peter Naur, same typewriter
	and with section numbers following those of the Algol60 report.
	The Algol 60 report was also published in the
	<a href="languages/Algol60-ACM.pdf">Communications of the ACM</a>.
	There is a 
	<a href="languages/Algol60-Deutsch.pdf">German translation</a>
	of this original Algol60 report, produced by Kerner and his
	team in Jena, East-Germany (DDR), and published by Vieweg in
	West-Germany as a supplement to the journal
	"Elektronische Rechenanlagen".
	<p>
	But what you should really study is the
	<a href="languages/Algol60-RevisedReport.pdf">Revised Report on
	the Algorithmic Language Algol 60</a>, here in a rendition of
	the <i>Algol Manual der ALCOR Gruppe</i>, together with
	a report for a <a href="languages/Algol60-Subset.pdf">subset</a>
	of the language and the describtion of basic
	<a href="languages/Algol60-InputOutputProcedures.pdf">
	input/output procedures</a>.
	There is also an online
	<a href="http://www.masswerk.at/algol60/report.htm">
	HTML version</a> of the revised report.
	<p>
	<font size=-1>
	Note: The IFIP working group WG2.1 on Algol decided early on
	that they will keep the copyright and that the Algol 60 report
	shall be free to copy and  distribute, independent
	of some publisher. That was in 1960, long before any word of
	<i>open source</i> was voiced. It was just proper scientific
	procedure for such a document. If only standard bodies of today
	would show such an attitude!

<b>Burroughs Extended Algol</b> and <b>ESPOL</b><ul>
	Burroughs (which became a part of UNISYS) adopted and extended
	Algol 60 and used its
	<a href="languages/burroughs_B5500_ExtendedAlgol.pdf">
	Burroughs Extended Algol</a> for nearly all of its software on the
	B5500 and B6xxx series, which were suitable endowed for the
	execution of Algol programs,
	except for some operating system code, which was written in
	<a href="languages/burroughs_B5500_ESPOL_RefManOct67.pdf">
	ESPOL</a>, the <i>Executive Systems Problem Oriented Language</i>,
	which additionally included hardware-near operations.
	<p>
</ul>

<b>Simula 67</b><ul>
	Simula is a direct descendent of Algol 60 and with its class
	concept considered the grandma of object oriented programming.
	It is defined in a document called the
	<a href="languages/Simula-CommonBaseLanguage.pdf">
	Common Base Language</a>.
	<p>
</ul>

<b>Algol 68</b><ul>
	When IFIP WG 2.1 on Algol discussed the successor language for
	Algol 60 in 1965, Aad van Wijngaarden brought his proposal
	<a href="languages/VanWijngaarden-MR76.pdf">
	Orthogonal design and description of a formal language</a>
	to the meeting in Grenoble. This paper on two-level grammars
	split the working group into two camps: The one working on
	this basis on <i>Algol X</i>, which would become Algol 68, and
	the other one, which later became the IFIP WG 2.3 on Programming
	Methodology.
	As this working paper soon became famous, van Wijngaarden reissued
	it as report MR76 of the Mathematical Center Amsterdam.
	<p>
	<a href="languages/Algol68-Report.pdf">Algol 68 Report</a> with the
	<a href="languages/Algol68-ReportAttachement.pdf">attachment sheet</a>
	listing the metanotions of the two-level-grammar for your convenience.
	<p>
	The first usable Algol 68 system was a subset by the british
	RRE (Royal Radar Establishment, Malvern), called
	<a href="languages/Algol68R-UserGuide.pdf">Algol68-R</a>
	for the ICL1900 and ICL2900 series machines.
	<p>
	<a href="languages/Algol68-RevisedReport.pdf">
	Algol 68 Revised Report</a> reformatted and crossreferenced by
	<a href="http://members.dokom.net/w.kloke">W. B. Kloke.</a>
	There is also an official
	<a href="languages/Algol68-RR-Sublanguage.pdf">sublanguage</a>
	of the revised Algol 68 by Peter Hibbard, and an official
	report on the
	<a href="languages/Algol68-RR-HardwareRepresentation.pdf">
	hardware representation</a>, which makes good reading for
	the problems of that time with available peripheral equipment
	and the use of stropping conventions to indicate the kind
	of symbols in the program text.
	<p>
</ul>

<b>Algol-W</b><ul>
	When Niklaus Wirth spend some time in Stanford in the mid 60ies
	there was a /360, but without any compiler of the Algol family.
	Also at that time, he wrote a paper on record structures
	together with Tony Hoare, published in the CACM.
	On the practical side, he defined and implemented the
	language <a href="languages/AlgolW-Manual.pdf">Algol-W</a>,
	which can be seen as a direct precursor to Pascal.
	<p>
</ul>

<b>Pascal</b><ul>
	Niklaus Wirth defined Pascal in the very first report 
	of the ETH computer science department in 1970.
	He also implemented it on the CDC6600 computer.
	<a href="languages/Wirth-PascalRevisedReport.pdf">
	The Programming Language Pascal (Revised Report)</a>
	appeared in November 1972 and layed the foundation
	for the whole Pascal language movement.
	<p>
	This was further helped by <a href="languages/Wirth-PascalS.pdf">
	Pascal-S</a>, a subset for running student jobs in a quick
	turn-around batch system. This report contains the whole
	compiler, written in Pascal, of course.
	<p>
	<ul><i>I'm looking for a good copy of Ammann's report
	on the P-code compiler, the next step to popularize
	Pascal and making it widely available. I only have
	dirty and torn xerox copy of that</i>.</ul>
	<p>
	Whereas Wirth's Pascal was a practical compromise for teaching
	structured programming of reasonably small programs in a
	batch environment, a number of derivates appeared
	rather soon, often very specific to the needs of the
	various operating environment, and loaded with features,
	the best known being Turbo-Pascal by Borland.
	As a reaction to that, there are two ISO standards on Pascal,
	<a href="languages/iso-iec-7185-1990-Pascal.pdf">
	ISO/IEC 7185:1990 Pascal</a>, and
	<a href="languages/iso-iec-10206-1990-ExtendedPascal.pdf">
	ISO/IEC 10206:1990 Extended Pascal</a>.
	<p>
	Any discussion of Pascal would however be incomplete without
	Brian Kernighan's critique
	<a href="languages/Kernighan-WhyPascalIsNotMyFavoriteProgrammingLanguage.pdf">
	Why Pascal is not my favorite programming language</a>.
	<p>
</ul>

<b>Modula-2</b> and <b>Modula-3</b><ul>
	<a href="languages/Wirth-Modula2.pdf">
	Modula-2</a>
	<br>
	Niklaus Wirth, ETH report 36, november 1980
	<p>
	A team at Digital and Olivetti defined a worthy successor:
	<a href="languages/DEC-Modula3-SRC052.pdf">
	Modula-3 Report (Revised)</a>,
	DEC SRC, november 89, but as usually the case, the actual use and feel
	of a language is largely determined by available libraries:
	<a href="languages/DEC-Modula3-SRC113.pdf">
	Some Useful Modula-3 Interfaces</a>,
	DEC SRC, december 93.
	The language evolved further and is described on a
	<a href="http://www.research.compaq.com/SRC/m3defn/html/complete.html">
	web page</a> and a
	<a href="languages/Cardelli-Modula3.pdf">pdf snapshot</a> thereof.
	More recent stuff is found on
	<a href="http://www.m3.org">www.m3.org</a>.
	<p>
</ul>

<b>PL360</b><ul>
	The 1960ies saw a number of approaches to replace assembly
	language, but nevertheless work close to the machine architecture
	under the name <i>machine-oriented higher level languages</i>
	or <i>MOHLL</i> for short.
	Wirth's PL360 is the best known example. He created it to write
	the Algol-W compiler at Stanford.
	<br>
	The <a href="languages/pl360man.pdf">PL360 Reference Manual</a>
	(<a href="languages/pl360man.txt">ascii</a>)
	defines the language.
	Otherwise, there is Wirth's article
	<i>PL/360, A Programming Language for the 360 Computers</i>
	in JACM 15(1), of january 1968, and
	Richard Guertin has a
	<a href="http://lindy.stanford.edu/~guertin/document/pl360txt.html">
	textbook</a> for his courses at Stanford.
	<p>
	After PL360 there have been a number of similar languages,
	mostly forgotten today.
	<p>
</ul>

<b>Bliss</b><ul>
	<a href="languages/BlissLanguageGuide.pdf">
	Bliss Language Guide</a> by digital equipment corp.,
	2nd edition, january 1980, for Bliss-11, Bliss-32, and
	Bliss-36, and the
	<a href="languages/VAX-11_Bliss-32_UsersGuide.pdf">
	VAX-11 Bliss-32 User's Guide</a> of 1980, for VAX/VMS V2.
	Finally, the
	<a href="languages/BlissPocketGuide.pdf">
	BLISS pocket guide</a>
	<p>
</ul>

<b>BCPL</b><ul>
	BCPL is a successor of the CPL, but today mostly remembered
	as precursor to C. Here is a scan of my copy of Richard's
	<a href="languages/Richards-BCPL-ReferenceManual.pdf">
	BCPL Reference Manual</a> of 1967 at MIT, but
	<a href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/">
	Dennis Ritchie</a> has 
	<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/bcpl.pdf">
	OCR-ed and edited it</a> as well as written a
	<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/bcpl.html">
	web page on BCPL</a>.
	At XEROX PARC
	<a href="languages/xerox-parc-bcpldoc.pdf">BCPL</a>
	was used for the Alto and other machines, before they embarked
	on MESA and other languages.
	<p>
</ul>

<b>C</b><ul>
	The <a href="languages/Ritchie-CReferenceManual.pdf">
	C Reference Manual</a> by
	<a href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/">Dennis Ritchie</a>
	from the 6th edition of Unix operating system, about 1976
	is the version that made C known in the research community.
	It was accompanied by Brian Kernighan's
	<a href="languages/Kernighan-CTutorial.pdf">
	Programming in C - A Tutorial</a>.
	The compiler for next version of the language came with the
	7th edition and the describing document is the original
	Kernighan &amp; Ritchie <i>The C Programming Language</i> book. 
	More on the
	<a href="languages/Ritchie-CHistory-HOPL2paper.pdf">History of C</a>
	you find on
	<a href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/">Dennis Ritchie's
	web page</a>!
	<p>
</ul>

<b>C++</b><ul>
	The initial version of C++ is described in three Bell Labs reports
	by Bjarne Stroustrup, all from 1984:
	<a href="languages/Stroustrup-CplusplusReferenceManual.pdf">
	C++ Reference Manual</a> (CSTR 108),
	<a href="languages/Stroustrup-DataAbstractionInC.pdf">
	Data Abstraction in C</a> (CSTR 109), and
	<a href="languages/Stroustrup-CplusplusTutorial.pdf">
	C++ Tutorial</a> (CSTR 113).
	Just a few pages each -- what a difference to modern C++.

	Bjarne Stroustrup</a>'s C++ web page!
	<p>
</ul>

<b>PL/I</b><ul>
	"Fat" programming languages aren't new, and the prototypical example
	without doubt is PL/1. Here is the
	<a href="languages/IBM-PLI-F-LangRefMan.pdf">
	IBM PL/I (F) Reference Manual</a> of 1969.
	For modern PL/I see
	<a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/ad/pli/library/">
	IBM PL/I family library</a>, where you can download pdf files
	of current manuals. For your convenience I mirrored the
