This change meant that SIDEARM could no longer utilize these tags to display videos to sport specific pages. To rectify this situation, our team of programmers came up with an improved way of posting videos to sport specific pages. This will also give you more control to in choosing what videos appear and in what order they show &hellip;</p>
