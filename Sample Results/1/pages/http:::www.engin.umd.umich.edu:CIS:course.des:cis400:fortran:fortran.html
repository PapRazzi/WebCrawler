<h2>History</h2>

<p>One of the oldest programming languages, the FORTRAN was developed by a team of
programmers at IBM led by John Backus, and was first published in 1957. The name FORTRAN
is an acronym for FORmula TRANslation, because it was designed to allow easy translation
of math formulas into code. </p>

<p>Often referred to as a <i>scientific language</i>, FORTRAN was the first <i>high-level</i>
language, using the first compiler ever developed. Prior to the development of FORTRAN
computer programmers were required to program in machine/assembly code, which was an
extremely difficult and time consuming task, not to mention the dreadful chore of
debugging the code. The objective during it's design was to create a programming language
that would be: simple to learn, suitable for a wide variety of applications, <i>machine
independent</i>, and would allow complex mathematical expressions to be stated similarly
to regular algebraic notation. While still being almost as efficient in execution as
assembly language. Since FORTRAN was so much easier to code, programmers were able to
write programs 500% faster than before, while execution efficiency was only reduced by
20%, this allowed them to focus more on the problem solving aspects of a problem, and less
on coding. </p>

<p>FORTRAN was so innovative not only because it was the first high-level language, but
also because of it's compiler, which is credited as giving rise to the branch of computer
science now known as <i>compiler theory</i>. Several years after it's release FORTRAN had
developed many different <i>dialects</i>, (due to special <i>tweaking</i> by programmers
trying to make it better suit their personal needs) making it very difficult to transfer
programs from one machine to another. </p>

<p>These problems lead the <i>American Standards Association</i> (now known as the <i>American
National Standards Association</i>) to release it's first <i>Standard for a Programming
Language</i>in 1966. This first standardized version has come to be known as FORTRAN '66
(aka.. FORTRAN IV). </p>

<p>Despite this standardization, a few years later, various new <i>dialects</i> began to
surface again, requiring the <i>Standards Association</i> review the language again. This
version is known as FORTRAN '77. This version was released in 1978 (it was called '77
because the Association began it's review in 1977), with several new features. Some of the
more notable properties were; new error handling methods, and mechanisms for managing
large-scale programs. The latest version; Fortran '90 (released in 1990, using the new
capitalization scheme) added even more new features, such as support for: recursion,
pointers, and for programmer-defined data types. {<strong>Fortran 90's future</strong> -
Current research in complier theory involves equipping compilers to generate object code,
that is able to exploit the capabilities of massively parallel computers. Thr Fortran 90
compilers are key targets of such research} <br>

<h2>Significant Language Features</h2>

<p>Some of the more significant features of the language are as listed below: <br>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Simple to learn</strong> - when FORTRAN was design one of the objectives was to
    write a language that was easy to learn and understand. </li>
  <li><strong>Machine Independent</strong> - allows for easy transportation of a program from
    one machine to another. </li>
  <li><strong>More natural ways to express mathematical functions</strong> - FORTRAN permits
    even severely complex mathematical functions to be expressed similarly to regular
    algebraic notation. </li>
  <li><strong>Problem orientated language</strong> </li>
  <li><strong>Remains close to and exploits the available hardware</strong> </li>
  <li><strong>Efficient execution</strong> - there is only an approximate 20% decrease in
    efficiency as compared to assembly/machine code. </li>
  <li><strong>Ability to control storage allocation</strong> -programmers were able to easily
    control the allocation of storage (although this is considered to be a dangerous practice
    today, it was quite important some time ago due to limited memory. </li>
  <li><strong>More freedom in code layout</strong> - unlike assembly/machine language, code
    does not need to be laid out in rigidly defined columns, (though it still must remain
    within the parameters of the FORTRAN source code form). </li>
</ul>

<h2>Areas of Application</h2>

<p>FORTRAN is useful for a wide variety of applications, some of the more outstanding ones
are as follows: 

<ul>
  <li><strong>Number crunching</strong> - due to the more natural (like it's true algebraic
    form) way of expressing complex mathematical functions and it's quick execution time,
    FORTRAN is easy and efficient at processing mathematical equations. </li>
  <li><strong>Scientific, mathematical, statistical, and engineering type procedures</strong>
    -due to it's rapid number-crunching ability FORTRAN is a good choice for these type of
    applications. </li>
</ul>

<p>Basically FORTRAN is most useful for applications that are <i>&quot;computational-bound&quot;</i>
rather than <i>&quot;I/O bound&quot;</i>. <br>
