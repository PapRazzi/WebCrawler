The MIIPS (Multipurpose Interactive Image Processing System) package is available
at no cost to interested individuals
and organizations.  This scientific and engineering package, which is
geared toward astronomy,  performs image 
display, image analysis, plotting, and function fitting.  Some of the
operations include flat fielding, image arithmetic, image rotation, 
image cutting and pasting, image expansion and contraction,
finding features, centroiding features, Fourier analysis 
(1- and 2-dimensional for any size array), wavelength calibration of spectra, 
aperture photometry, surface photometry and profile analysis,
crowded-field photometry, and nonlinear least 
squares fitting.  Image
display and plotting are supported on several different devices, and
postscript and eps output are easily produced.  
All the source code is available so that custom applicatons can be
constructed.  The MIIPS astronomy software package, which runs under VAX OpenVMS and 
UNIX (more specifically, Linux, but only some
components right now) can be <A HREF="miips_download.html">
downloaded</A> from this site.  Support for Alpha OpenVMS is not yet available.
The development of MIIPS started in 1981 at the University of Michigan from the 
Pandora and Roo packages, which were created at the Mt. Stromlo and Sliding 
Springs Observatory, Australia.  These, in turn, made use some elements of the 
GYPSY package developed in Groningen.

<P>Note:  Under Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) xgterm fails to give cursor readback.  A recent update, xgterm-tiger,
solves this problem.  Likewise, for Linux kernel 2.4, the update xgterm-fedora should be used.
<P>
The MIIPS package
includes an enhanced version of SAOimage, a pseudocolor display server,
on which it is possible to not only display images as in the origial version, 
but display images, video, and cursors, and plot data, all under control of
easily written user programs.  A library of callable subroutines is provided for
this purpose, and all source code is freely available.  Several demo programs 
which have been compiled for different operating systems are available as well.
<P>
Also included in MIIPS, and as a separate package, is the Binary Star 
Combined Solution Package, which
enables one to simultaneously consider astrometric, speckle, and 
spectroscopic data in deriving the orbit of a binary or multiple star system.  
The program can also solve for the orbits of planets around
stars.  A future version will be able to handle interferometric
data simultaneously as well.
<P>
Also included in MIIPS, and as a separate package, is the FITS Library Package. 
This consists of several routines to carry out operations with FITS image
files.
<P>
Included as well in MIIPS, and as a separate package, is the Grades program 
which manages student grades
in a feature-rich way.
<P>
MIIPS includes a variety of plotting options, i.e., XY plotting, contour
plotting, and mesh plotting.  This plotting software is also available as
a self-contained package.
