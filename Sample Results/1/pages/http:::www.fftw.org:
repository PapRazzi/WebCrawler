<H2>Introduction</H2>

<abbr title="Fastest Fourier Transform in the West">FFTW</abbr> is a C
subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)
in one or more dimensions, of arbitrary input size, and of both real
and complex data (as well as of even/odd data, i.e. the discrete
cosine/sine transforms or DCT/DST).  We believe that FFTW,
which is <a href="faq/section1.html#isfftwfree" title="explanation of FFTW's free-ness">free software</a>, should become the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> library of choice for most
applications.

<p>The latest official release of FFTW is version <b>3.3.3</b>,
available from <a href="download.html">our download page</a>.  Version
3.3 introduced support for the AVX x86 extensions, a
distributed-memory implementation on top of MPI, and a Fortran 2003
API.  Version 3.3.1 introduced support for the ARM Neon
extensions. See the <a href="release-notes.html">release notes</a> for
more information.

<P>The FFTW package was developed at <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu"
title="MIT web page"><abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr></A> by <A
HREF="http://www.fftw.org/~athena/" title="Matteo Frigo's home page">Matteo Frigo</A> and <A
HREF="http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/" title="Steven G. Johnson's home page">Steven G.  Johnson</A>. 

<p>Our <A HREF="http://www.fftw.org/benchfft/">benchmarks</A>,
performed on on a variety of platforms, show that FFTW's performance
is typically superior to that of other publicly available FFT
software, and is even competitive with vendor-tuned codes.  In
contrast to vendor-tuned codes, however, FFTW's performance is
<i>portable</i>: the same program will perform well on most
architectures without modification. Hence the name, "FFTW," which
stands for the somewhat whimsical title of "<b>Fastest Fourier
Transform in the West</b>."

FFTW 3.3.3 is the latest official version of FFTW (refer to the <a
href="release-notes.html">release notes</a> to find out what is new).
<!-- Subscribe to
the <a href="cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/fftw-announce">fftw-announce
mailing list</a> to receive announcements of future updates.  --> 
Here is a list of some of FFTW's more interesting features:

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.fftw.org/benchfft/" title="benchmark
results">Speed.</a> (Supports SSE/SSE2/Altivec, since version
3.0.  Version 3.3.1 supports AVX and ARM Neon.)

<li>Both one-dimensional and <b>multi-dimensional</b> transforms.

<li><b>Arbitrary-size</b> transforms.  (Sizes with small prime factors are
best, but FFTW uses O(N log N) algorithms even for prime sizes.)

<li>Fast transforms of <b>purely real</b> input or output data.

<li>Transforms of real even/odd data: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform">discrete cosine transform</a>
(DCT) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_sine_transform">discrete sine transform</a> (DST), types I-IV.  (Version 3.0 or later.)

<li>Efficient handling of <b>multiple, strided</b> transforms. (This lets you
do things like transform multiple arrays at once, transform one
dimension of a multi-dimensional array, or transform one field of a
multi-component array.)

<li><a href="http://www.fftw.org/parallel/parallel-fftw.html"
title="parallel FFTW manual">Parallel transforms</a>: parallelized
code for platforms with <abbr title="Symmetric
Multi-Processing">SMP</abbr> machines with some flavor

(e.g. POSIX) or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openmp">OpenMP</a>. An <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpi/"
title="Argonne MPI home page"><abbr title="Message Passing
Interface">MPI</abbr></a> version for distributed-memory transforms is
also available in FFTW 3.3.  

<li><b>Portable</b> to any platform with a C compiler.

<p>
If you are still using
<b>FFTW 2.x</b>, please note that FFTW 2.x was last updated in 1999
and it is obsolete.  Please upgrade to FFTW 3.x.  The API of FFTW 3.x
is <b>incompatible</b> with that of FFTW 2.x, for reasons of
performance and generality (see
the <a href="http://www.fftw.org/faq/section3.html#fftw2to3">FAQ</a>
or
the <a href="fftw3_doc/Upgrading-from-FFTW-version-2.html">manual</a>).

First, read the <a href="faq/">FFTW Frequently Asked Questions</a>
document.

<p>For general questions about Fourier transforms, see our <a
href="links.html">links to FFT-related resources.</a> People often ask
us how to compute a subset of the FFT outputs, so we have posted a
short <a href="pruned.html">discussion of pruned FFTs</a>.

<P>We benchmarked FFTW against many other FFT programs, in one to
three dimensions, on a variety of platforms. You can view the results
from this benchmark, or download it to run on your own machine and
compiler, at the <a href="http://www.fftw.org/benchfft/">benchFFT web
page</a>.

<p>An audio <a href="http://www.rce-cast.com/Podcast/rce-73-fftw-fastest-fourier-transform-in-the-west.html">interview of the FFTW authors</a> is available from the RCE podcast program.

<h2>Awards</h2>

<p>FFTW received
the <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/opportunities/wilkinsonprize/3rd-1999.php">1999
J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software</a>, which is awarded
every four years to the software that "best addresses all phases of
the preparation of high quality numerical software."  Wilkinson was a
seminal figure in modern numerical analysis as well as a key proponent
of the notion of reusable, common libraries for scientific computing,
and we are especially honored to receive this award in his memory.

<p>
Our paper "A Fast Fourier Transform Compiler" (in PLDI 1999) received
the Most Influential PLDI Paper award in 2009.
