<h4>NetMath For Web Based Computation</h4>
<br>

NetMath is a web browser which knows something about math.  It has
<br>built in plotting engines, and the ability to communicate with
<br>computation servers.  This makes it possible to do local graphics,
<br>zooming, and panning, yet to take advantage of sophisticated
<br>computational programs.

These pages are best viewed under NetMath.  You might
<br><netmath swallow>want to 
<a href=obtaining.html><netmath swallow>download it.
</a>
</font>
<p>
Have a look at
<ul>
<li><a href=sample.html> sample calculations</a> and a discussion.
</ul>
<p>
Some of the programs that NetMath knows about are:
<ul>
<li><a href=pmaxima.html>maxima</a> for symbolic computations,
<li><a href=pari.html>pari</a> for advanced number theoretic calculations,
<li><a href=gap.html>gap</a> for group theoretic computations,
routines.
</ul>

<p>Documents contain active and editable items, and the results of
computations  <br>
appear in the document.  The <a href=nhtml.html>specification</a>
adds 2 new html tags, as well as some <br>
additional attributes.   Some
<a href=../courses/427k/>
course material </a> is available for differential equations
Also for
<a href=../courses/408c/>
calculus.
</a><br>
We also can now using a special wish have <a href=math-symbol.html>math symbol display</a>


<p>NetMath runs under Windows, MacOS, and Unix.   
Look at <a href=obtaining.html>instructions</a> on obtaining it.<br>
For the above computations you need an <b>eval</b> enabled browser
<br>such as <b>netmath</b>.   For help on printing plots <a href=printing.html>see this</a>
