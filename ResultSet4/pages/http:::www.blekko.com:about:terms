<h1 id="dashTitle">infringement policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective May 2010</strong></p>
<p>It is the policy of Blekko, Inc., d/b/a blekko (“blekko”) to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright and trademark infringement. Regardless of whether blekko would be found to be liable for such copyright or trademark infringement under United States law or the laws of the applicable country, we may respond to allegations of such infringement by removing or disabling access to content that is claimed to be infringing or by terminating particular subscribers’ ability to access the blekko website and services. In the event that we terminate access to the blekko website or remove search results in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith effort to contact the site or content owners or administrators in order to permit them to make a counter-notification.</p>
<p>Please note that, in the event you materially misrepresent that a particular material or activity is infringing your copyright or trademark, you will be liable for all damages incurred (including costs and attorneys’ fees) as a result of such material misrepresentation. Accordingly, we suggest that you contact an attorney before notifying blekko of infringement if you are not certain whether particular content is infringing your copyright or trademark.</p>
<h2>Infringement Notice</h2>
<p>If you believe that your copyright or trademark is being infringed on the blekko website, please send us a written notice that must include the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>An identification of the copyrighted or trademarked work that you believe has been infringed;</li>
<li>An identification of the allegedly infringing content within the work listed in item #1 above, and sufficient information to permit blekko to identify it on the website. For a web search result, you must identify the search results obtained that link directly to a webpage that allegedly contains infringing material. In other words, you must provide us with (a) the search query you used and (b) the web address (URL) of each search result you allege contains infringing material;</li>
<li>A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the use of the content identified in your notice in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright or trademark owner, its agent, or the law;</li>
<li>A statement by you that you swear and attest, under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright/trademark owner or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</li>
<li>Your signature (in either electronic or physical form), along with your name, address, telephone number and, if available, email address.</li>
<h2>Counter-Notice</h2>
<p>While it is our policy to respond to clear notices of trademark and copyright infringement, if you believe that your content should not have been removed for alleged copyright or trademark infringement, you may send us a written counter-notice. Such counter-notice must include the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>An identification of the work that was removed or disabled, and the location (such as a URL) of the website on which it would have been found prior to its removal;</li>
<li>A statement by you that you swear and attest, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the search result and/or content was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification. For trademark disputes only: information reasonably sufficient to explain why you believe you are not infringing the trademarked work;</li>
