    <h1>C-- News for May, 2001</h1>
    Here is the C-- news as of May, 2001. <br>
    (There is <a href="2000.07.html">old news</a> from last year
    still available.) 

    <p>We still don't have a working compiler that implements the
    full Version&nbsp;2 specification. Essentially, our status is
    that a great deal of interesting stuff has been going on, but
    nothing is actually finished.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>We are planning a C-- workshop at Harvard for late July
      or mid-August. The two topics of discussion will be <em>types
      and C--</em> and <em>support for concurrency</em>.</li>

      <li>All the developers have been at work on a new language
      specification, to be called version 2.0. The new manual is
      not quite ready as we have been working on the
      implementation.</li>

      <li>Norman Ramsey and Simon Peyton Jones have put toegether a
      <a href='../concurrency.html'>concurrency proposal</a>      . There are substantial points of interest in the proposal,
      but many problems remain, especially problems of <em>stack
      overflow</em> and <em>pre-emption</em>.</li>

      <li>Daniel Damian has worked on using type-directed partial
      evaluation to specialize analyses and optimizations used in
      the compiler. Our hope is that the specialized code will
      enable us to use an machine-dependent representation of
      instructions within the compiler. We expect this will
      substantially reduce time and space costs. The technique
      should also have interesting applications to other problems,
      e.g., proof-carrying code.</li>

      <li>Lee Feigenbaum has done some preliminary work on
      automatically deriving a code generator from a machine
      description. We hope to complete this work and use the code
      generators in the Quick C-- compiler.</li>

      <li>Christian Lindig has pushed forward the development of
      Quick C--, including translation to intermediate code,
      flow-graph representations for optimization, liveness
      analysis, and register allocation.</li>

      <li>Norman Ramsey is working on a version of BURG for
      Objective Caml. We will use this tool to implement both Lee
      Feigenbaum's code generators and any code generators we might
      write by hand.</li>

      <li>Fermin Reig has been adapting the Objective Caml front
      end to a restricted version of C-- (<tt>cmmc</tt>, which is
      built on top of MLRISC). He has got working code!</li>

      <li>Sergei Egorov: <a href=
      "http://www.malgil.com/trc/">trampolining C--</a>. Sergei has
      built an implementation of C-- by compiling C-- to C and
      using a trampoline. It is basically a proof-of-concept
      implementation that demonstrates a popular method of
      compiling tail-recursive procedures to portable C.</li>

      <li>Jon Eddy will be spending the summer looking at two
      problems related to C--: first, how to recognize and identify
      machine instructions efficiently, even in the presence of
      interesting optimizations. Second: whether some of the C--
      `unchecked run-time errors' can in fact be checked at run
      time, and if so at what cost.</li>

      <li>John Dias will be working on an `optimization backplane'
      for putting together the back end of the Quick C-- compiler.
      The idea is to give a clean framework for phase ordering and
      other aspects of configuring the compiler.</li>
