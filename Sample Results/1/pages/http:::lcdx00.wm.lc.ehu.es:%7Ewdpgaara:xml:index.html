<h2>An XML parser in Fortran</h2>

<p class="shinput">NOTE: Toby White took over most development of xmlf90, renamed it FoX,
and released a more robust SAX parser, a general purpose XML generation library, and
a CML output library. The work is now being continued by Andrew Walker. More details can be found 
<a href="http://www1.gly.bris.ac.uk/~walker/FoX/




">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The xmlf90 package now 
includes a new DOM interface, and WXML, a
library to write well-formed XML.
Jon Wakelin
has joined the development, and
we use the <a href="http://nn-online.org/code">
strings module by Mart Rentmeester</a>.
</p>

Features:
<ul>
<li>An almost fully functional SAX-like interface.</li>
<li>An XPath-inspired interface for direct access to
document sections, based on SAX.
<li>A DOM API conforming to basically the full W3C DOM 1.0 specification.
<li>Detection of malformed documents, with reporting of the exact location
of the error.</li>
<li>Support for handling numerical datasets</li>
<li>Written in the <a href="http://fortran.com/imagine1/">F</a>
 subset of Fortran (the DOM subsystem uses non-pure functions, though).</li>
<li>Freely available under the BSD license.</li>
</ul>

<p>
An <a href="pseudo/index.html">
example</a>
 of a "real-world" application of the parser is in the handling
of XML pseudopotential data for electronic-structure codes. This 
work is the context of the <a href="http://www.tddft.org/fsatom">FSAtom</a>
project.

<p>You might want to have a look at two other projects (that I know of) 
also aimed at parsing XML in Fortran: those of
<a href="http://nn-online.org/code">Mart Rentmeester</a> and
<a href="http://xml-fortran.sourceforge.net/">Arjen Markus</a>.
