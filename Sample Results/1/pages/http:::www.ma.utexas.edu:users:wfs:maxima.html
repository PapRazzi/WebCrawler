Maxima is a Common Lisp implementation of MIT's Macsyma system for
computer based algebra.  Maxima is now about to be released under the
GNU Public License.  I have maintained and extended Maxima for the
last 15 years, but have only recently received <a
href=/users/wfs/maxima-doe-auth.gif> formal permission from DOE</a>, to release
this under GPL as a derivative work.  This formalizes earlier 
opinions from DOE.

<ul>
<li> Plotting via netmath over the network.
<li> Computations over network
<li> Well tested on a large array of problems.
<li> Source level Debugger for maxima code
<li> Documentation available as <a href=/maxima/index.html>html</a>,
     or texinfo and so info, and so dvi and postscript.
<li> Latest source development version <a href=http://cvs.ma.utexas.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/maxima/?cvsroot=maxima> available </a> or look here for how to download <a href=/users/wfs/cvs.html>using cvs</a>.
<li> Easy to extend in fundamentally new ways, because
you have complete access to source, and access to Common Lisp.
<li> Portable to many systems.
<li> Now covered by GNU public license, so it will stay free.
<li> Was the first computer algebra system, and is one of
the best.
<li> Some screenshots of xmaxima: ms windows or xwindows version are the same:
 <ul>
 <li><a href=maxima-screen2.gif> xmaxima initial screen</a>
 <li><a href=maxima-screen3.gif> a plot invoked from bottom window</a>
 <li><a href=maxima-screen4.gif> direction fields in xmaxima/netmath </a>
 </ul>
<li> It is possible to evaluate forms from web pages in local maxima
 or in remote ones.   Also to access pari, octave, and gap from netmath. 
<li> Some screenshots of source level debugging debugger
 <ul>
 <li><a href=maxima-debug1.gif> debugger using dbl under emacs </a> (arrow points to where you are executing)
 <li><a href=maxima-debug2.gif> debugger in in xmaxima</a> (current execution line in red)
 <li><a href=maxima-debug3.gif> help commands for debugger</a>
</ul>
<li> see maxima <a href=http://www.math.utexas.edu/mailman/listinfo/maxima>mailing list</a>
</ul>

You can look testdrive Maxima under NetMath over the network, by
going to <a href=/users/wfs/netmath/netmath.html>NetMath</a>

<h3>Downloads</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are Debian and Red Hat prebuilt packages available on
the web.
<li>You may download <a href=http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/wfs/pub/maxima/>download</a> the source (good for unix), and a linux compiled version.
<li>There is a version of maxima for MS Windows, using the free
mingw gcc compilers:   
<a href=http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/wfs/maxima-download/maxima55l-setup.exe>
download</a> this Windows executable version.
<ul> source and documentaion snapshots:
<li>of the documentation in <a href=http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/wfs/maxima.pdf>pdf</a> format
<li>manual in <a href=http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/wfs/maxima.dvi>dvi</a> format.
<li>current <a href=http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/wfs/maxima-src-snapshot.tgz>
source snapshot of Maxima</a>
<li>current <a href=http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/wfs/gcl-src-snapshot.tgz>
source snapshot of GCL</a>
</ul>
</ul>

The Windows version is essentially the same as <b>xmaxima</b> available in the Unix version under x windows.
It incorporates a small web browser (netmath) into the maxima display.
So pages of sample calculations can be stored in web form, and the
input simply edited.   Computations of maxima, and plots are done
locally, but the computations using some other systems are done remotely.


To submit new code please follow <a href=submit-maxima.html>guidelines</a>
See <a href=maxima-gcl.html>here</a> for using the above maxima as a lisp.

<h5>Building Maxima on Unix</h5>
<ul>
<li> First get latest version of <a href=ftp://ftp.ma.utexas.edu/pub/gcl>gcl</a> and compile it.
<li> Get latest version of <a href=ftp://ftp.ma.utexas.edu/pub/maxima>maxima</a>and compile it.
<li> do make install
<li> usually the current source snapshots are also a reasonable bet, since
I make sure they are compatible levels.  
</ul>

There is a compiled version for linux, in the <a href=//ftp.ma.utexas.edu/pub/maxima>directory</a>.    I will update that version someday.   There are
rpms for redhat and .deb files for debian, found with the usual rpmfind and debian search methods.


The source is now under <a href=cvs.html>cvs</a>  (or see <a href=http://cvs.ma.utexas.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/maxima/?cvsroot=maxima>here</a> and you can download various versions, including any changes.   We will still put tar releases of the 
sources in the ftp directories.   You may also get a snapshots of documentation and source:
