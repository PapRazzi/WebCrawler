  <article>
    <p>I tweet from <a href="http://twitter.com/dhh">@dhh</a> and email from <a href="mailto:david@heinemeierhansson.com">david@heinemeierhansson.com</a>.</p>

    <p>I write <a href="archive.html">essays on this site</a> and <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/writers/dhh">on the 37signals blog</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="rails">Creator of Ruby on Rails</h2>
    <p><a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> is an open-source web framework that's optimized for programmer happiness and beautiful code. I created Rails in 2004 and continue to lead the development.</p>

    <p>Hundreds of thousands of programmers around the world have built amazing applications using Rails. Some of the more famous include <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a>, <a href="http://500px.com">500px</a>, and <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>.

    <h2 id="37signals">Partner at 37signals</h2>
    <p>We make software for the web at <a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a>. Our most popular product is <a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>, a project management and collaboration application. We also make the simple CRM <a href="http://highrisehq.com">Highrise</a> and the group chat app <a href="http://campfirenow.com">Campfire</a>.</p>

    <p>The company has been around since 1999. I run it together with my business partner, Jason Fried, and our lovely team of 34 programmers, designers, supporters, and sysops.</p>

    <h2 id="rework">Best-selling author</h2>
    <p><a href="http://37signals.com/rework">REWORK</a> is a New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Sunday Times best seller with more than 300,000 copies sold around the world. It's a book about starting and running businesses a better way. It's a short read, so you can finish it in a couple of hours. It's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rework/dp/0307463745">available on Amazon</a>.</p>

    <a href="http://37signals.com/rework"><img src="images/rework/front-cover.png" width="257" style="margin-right:20px"></a><a href="http://37signals.com/rework"><img src="images/rework/back-cover.png" width="257"></a>

    <p>I also co-wrote <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com">Getting Real</a>, the predecessor to REWORK, and <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/rails3/agile-web-development-with-rails">Agile Web Development with Rails</a>. I'm currently writing a new book.</p>

    <h2 id="speaker">Public speaker</h2>

    <p>I give talks on business and technology. My most popular talk is The Secret To Making Money Online, delivered at Startup School in 2008. It's about how you don't need to aim to be a billionaire or take lots of venture capital to have a successful startup (and life):</p>

    </div>

    <p>Along the same lines, I debated Jason Calcanis from This Week in Startups on business models, bubbles, capitalism, quality of life, market share vs. profit share, running a business vs. selling a business, and a variety of other related topics (fast-forward 47 minutes):</p>

    <p>Finally, I told Stanford Business School how to <a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2351">Unlearn Your MBA</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="driver">Race-car driver</h2>
    <p>I started racing sportscars in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K3dLCfrHfI">Cayman Interseries</a> in 2009, moved to 911 GT3 Cup Cars at the end of 2010 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwUt-CXsgho">winning the gold class in my first race!</a>), and then went all out in 2011 with races in <a href="http://imsachallenge.com/season/standings/2011#Platinum%20Cup">GT3 Challenge</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBXYomaVsBQ">Radical Masters</a>, ALMS GTC, Grand-Am ST, and ILMC (in Lotus below).</p>

    <p>That was all warm up for my break-out season in 2012. Together with <a href="http://www.alms.com/teams/conquest-endurance">Conquest Endurance</a>, I competed in the American Le Mans Series with LMP2 class-wins at Mosport and Road America to finish second in the championship. That performance earned me <a href="http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/alms-2012-rookies-of-the-year-david-heinemeier-hansson-alex-popow/">SPEED's Rookie of the Year</a>.</p>

    <img src="images/racing/mosport-win.jpg" width="540" height="237" alt="Winning the Mosport GP">

    <p>I also raced in the World Endurance Championship LMP2 class with <a href="http://www.oak-racing.com">OAK Racing</a> at Silverstone, Spa-Francorchamps, and the 24 hours of Le Mans. Racing at Le Mans had been a dream of mine since watching my countryman, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kristensen">Tom Kristensen aka Mr. Le Mans</a>, win in 1997. I was honored to lead the LMP2 class for twelve laps and finish the race.</p>

    <p>I post <a href="https://www.youtube.com/dhhracing">race videos on YouTube</a> and tweet racing from <a href="http://twitter.com/dhhracing">@dhhracing</a>.</p>
