Our primary business is providing versions of our VAST high-level optimization 
product (parallelizing, vectorizing, and/or optimizing compiler components)
to developers of compiler systems targeting high-speed architectures, 
whether embedded processors, reconfigurable systems, 
desktop boxes or supercomputers. 
<h3>How does VAST interface with the Compiler?</h3>
VAST operates on compiler intermediate representations of the program 
(such as Edison Design Group IR) or directly on source code 
(through a compiler driver) to perform high-level optimizations, 
including loop nest optimizations and automatic vectorization and 
parallelization.  For example in a compiler system that used the EDG 
front end, VAST runs as a high-level optimization pass after the 
front end has parsed the program and before the back end generates 
code for the particular target system; VAST operates on the input 
EDG IR and generates restructured EDG IR where necessary to speed 
up the program.  
<h3>What if I don't use EDG?</h3>
For compilers using other intermediate representations, 
VAST is customized to take in that IR and regenerate its transformations 
in that IR.  VAST is generally customized to fit in with the specific 
programming methodology, programming tools, and architectural details 
of the target system.
<h3>What can VAST do?</h3>
VAST can restructure loops, add calls to performance intrinsics, 
bring external functions inline, and signal to the compiler backend 
by adding pragmas or marking other data structures.  
VAST features a large variety of loop optimizations, and has very 
extensive data dependency analysis, which it uses in its vectorization 
and parallelization of the code.  It can also pass this information on 
to the rest of the compiler in a variety of ways, ranging from 
indicating loops that have no array or pointer dependencies to 
explicitly adding data dependence arcs for all dependencies in a loop nest.  
(See <a href="tech_menu2.html">the menu</a> for a list of VAST's features.)

<h3>What types of systems can VAST target?</h3>
<font size=2>
The VAST technology <A href="targets.html">supports many types of systems</A>, including paralel, vector, VLIW, SIMD, superscalar, and others.   VAST itself is highly portable, and runs on all popular Unix, Linux and Windows versions.

<h3>VAST Optimization List</h3>
<font size=2>
We provide a very wide array of possible optimizations, transformations and information,
both in off-the-shelf modules and in customized forms,
and can operate on either intermediate representation or source language.

<h3>How can we license VAST?</h3>
<font size=2>
We have a "standard" 
<A href="do_business.html">business model</A>, but we've had to deal with
so many different kinds of customers and products that in practice
we're pretty flexible.   
We always work closely with our customers to customize and support the products 
to make sure we get peak performance from the target compiler and architecture.  
Testing and support are very high priorities for us.
