          Real-time campaign amplifies historic ruling to educate, engage and entertain public

        <h3>
          The Challenge
        </h3>
        <p>
          In 2008, voters passed Proposition 8 in California, denying gay and lesbian couples the fundamental right to marry. The American Foundation for Equal Rights (@AFER) is the sole sponsor of the federal court challenge to overturn Prop. 8 and a leader in the fight for marriage equality. As the landmark ruling on Prop. 8 by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals approached in 2012, the non-profit organization needed a way to rally supporters and keep the public informed about developments in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We knew all eyes would be on us on the day of the decision and we saw it as an opportunity to guide the conversation around the issue of marriage equality,” says Shumway Marshall, Online Director at @AFER. “We wanted to find a way for people to engage around the decision even if they couldn’t be at one of our events.”
        </p>        
        <h3>
          The Solution
        </h3>
        <img alt="The American Foundation for Equal Rights Screenshot" class="bordered" src="/a/1314118012/images/business/case-studies/afer-screenshot-1.png">
        <p>
          @AFER created a three-part campaign on Twitter involving “rapid response,” “direct response” and a live event. In the days leading up to the Ninth Circuit decision, @AFER focused on a constant stream of information, sharing updates from the legal team, the latest news coverage and reports from the two couples challenging Prop. 8. On the day of the ruling, the organization used Promoted Tweets in search to amplify awareness and shape the conversation by targeting keywords and hashtags related to marriage equality. This allowed @AFER to get their message in front of people actively searching for Tweets related to Prop. 8 and other relevant topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this “rapid response” part of the campaign, @AFER also utilized Promoted Tweets in timelines to feature live coverage of the day’s events, provide context around the decision and direct people to online resources to learn more. As @AFER broke the news on Twitter that Prop. 8 was again ruled unconstitutional, #prop8 organically emerged as a trending topic. @AFER remained the leading voice on the subject by optimizing the Promoted Tweets campaign in real time to target the terms people were searching for around the ruling as well as the emerging hashtags.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Twitter is a great resource to increase transparency and we used it to keep people engaged at every step,” says Marshall. “More than any other platform, Twitter centers around conversations. By engaging in that conversation, in real time, we were able to amplify our reach around the world at the precise moment people wanted to hear from us.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The days before and immediately following the ruling, @AFER seized the momentum of the decision to grow its house email list and drive fundraising. With Promoted Tweets in this “direct response” phase of the campaign, the organization directed people to a landing page urging them to stay engaged by registering email addresses or making a donation. People who completed the form on the landing page were entered to win two tickets to the Los Angeles premiere reading of “8,” a play based on the Prop. 8 federal court trial featuring top celebrities like Brad Pitt and George Clooney. The organization used Promoted Tweets in timelines and in search to promote the contest and incentivize landing page conversions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three days before the premiere of the play, @AFER announced it would live stream the performance on its Twitter profile page. To build buzz and drive viewership in such a short time frame, @AFER  leveraged Promoted Tweets in search featuring videos of celebrities like Rob Reiner previewing the play. These Promoted Tweets also directed people to RSVP for the live stream—another opportunity for @AFER to build its email database. The organization cross-promoted the live experience by targeting Promoted Tweets to the followers of high profile cast members as well as interest groups affiliated to @AFER.
        </p>
        <p>
          @AFER built anticipation on the day of the play’s premiere with a countdown and by posting exclusive red carpet and backstage content. During the live stream, the organization hosted an interactive chat on Twitter to add color for all the viewers as the play unfolded in real time. For example, @AFER tweeted background on witnesses featured in the play and linked to details on evidence as it was brought up in the play to give viewers context.
        </p>
        <p>
          “With Twitter, we added another engaging layer and dimension to the viewing experience,” says Marshall. “We were able to create this rich, dynamic connection to our core audience that was gathered at viewing parties around the world.”
        </p>
        <h3>
          The Results
        </h3>
        <p>
          On Twitter, @AFER achieved its goal of breaking the news that Prop. 8 was  again ruled unconstitutional and owning the conversation. The organization received  7,323 mentions on the day of the groundbreaking ruling. During the month of the campaign, @AFER had 4,500 mentions on Twitter—a 1,400% increase in mentions over previous months. The organization’s Klout score also increased from 65 to 85 during the month of the campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
          With its Promoted Tweets campaign, half of the entries for the contest were referred to @AFER’s landing page by Twitter.  On the day of the live stream, @AFER drove 210,000 views of the Prop. 8 play.  Since the day of the live stream, views of the 90 minute performance have risen to 790,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          “At such a historic moment, Twitter was the ideal way to build excitement, inform supporters and engage the public in dialogue,” says Marshall. “The flexibility of what we could do on Twitter—at every stage of our campaign—was completely unique and crucial to our success.”
