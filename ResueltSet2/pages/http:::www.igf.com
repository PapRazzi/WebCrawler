<p>The full highlights so far from <a href="http://www.igf.com/02finalists.html">this year's finalists</a> are as follows:</p>

</p><p>The jury announcements for this year are beginning with some of the industry professionals, independent game notables and former IGF award winners that will make up its Excellence in Design and Technical Achievement Awards, as well as high-profile additions to its Nuovo and Narrative awards, the first members of which were <a href="http://igf.com/2012/12/igf_2013_reveals_narrative_nuo.html">recently announced</a>.</p>

<p>Former <em>Journey</em> producer and designer and current Funomena co-founder Robin Hunicke will be joining both the Nuovo and Narrative juries. Also joining the Narrative jury is Telltale writer and designer Sean Vanaman, notable for his work co-writing the recent award-winning <em>Walking Dead</em> adventure series. And the Nuovo Award jury will also see the inclusion of designer, 
curator and Kokoromi art collective co-founder Heather Kelley and Lea 
Schoenfelder, creator of former IGF finalist <em>Ulitsa Dimitrova</em>.</p>

<p>While the juries continue to be assembled in advance of the kick-off of our next phase of the finalist selection process, we're happy to announce the following confirmed jurists.</p>

<p><u><strong>The Excellence in Design Award</strong></u></p>

<p>The Excellence in Design award is a category which seeks to highlight the innovation and quality of the underlying blueprint of each entered game -- component parts like its mechanic design, level design, and difficulty balancing.</p>

<p>Prior finalists and winners of the IGF Excellence in Design Award have included 2D Boy's cartoon construction puzzler <em>World of Goo</em>, Pocketwatch Games' abstracted multiplayer heist game <em>Monaco</em>, QCF's rogue-like puzzler <em>Desktop Dungeons</em> and procedurally-generated platformer <em>Spelunky</em>.

</p><p>The confirmed jury to date consists of the following:</p>

<p>All IGF Main Competition finalists for this year's event will receive the opportunity to accept a distribution agreement for Steam, a leading platform for distribution in today's burgeoning independent gaming market.</p>

<p>This means every single Main Competition finalist in each of the jury-voted categories - the Seumas McNally Grand Prize, Excellence In Design, Excellence In Art, Excellence In Narrative, Technical Excellence, Excellence in Audio, and even the Nuovo Award - can work directly with Steam to bring their titles to PC, Mac and Linux.</p>

<p>This agreement comes as the 2013 Independent Games Festival rolls out its new, cutting-edge judging website back-end - including a dedicated mobile judge app, social-style discussion tools for games, and the ability for judges and contestants to easily connect to resolve technical problems.</p>

<p>With over 200 distinguished judges discussing and recommending titles for named, discipline-specific juries in each of the seven main categories, IGF 2013 will announce its finalists in January 2013, and award winners at <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">Game Developers Conference 2013</a> in San Francisco this March.</p>

<p>Finalists and winners of the Independent Games Festival since its 1999 debut have included landmark indie games such as <i>Braid</i>, <i>World of Goo</i>, <i>Super Meat Boy</i>, <i>Portal</i> predecessor <i>Narbacular Drop</i>, <i>Minecraft</i>, and a host of other seminal titles. Valve joins other supporters of the 2013 IGF including media sponsors Gamasutra and Game Developer magazine, as well as Platinum Sponsor Microsoft Studios and Platinum Student Showcase Sponsor DigiPen.</p>

<p>Hello everybody, and welcome to a special IGF 2013 mid-stream announcement that, after much careful consideration and discussion, we decided was a necessity:</p>

<p><strong><u>We're adding a new category to this year's festival, Excellence in Narrative.</u></strong></p>

<p>This may not come as too much of a shock, because it's something that judges, entrants, and the general public have been asking for for quite some time now. Our initial decision to not add the category was not one we took lightly. </p>

<p>It was the subject of many rounds of internal discussion on both the necessity and logistics of adding a category devoted to recognizing narrative innovation, especially as we were making strides to <em>remove</em> categories and pare the festival down to a few core essentials.</p>

<p>But as judging kicked off in early October, it was clear that there was something special about this year's lineup of games in particular that made the absence of a Narrative category especially conspicuous. And so, because so many of our judges have said there are so many games in this year's festival that they specifically want to recognize for their world and their story, we are giving them an avenue to do so. </p>

<p>We'll be defining this new Excellence in Narrative category in much the same way our sister festival, the <a href="http://www.gamechoiceawards.com">Game Developers Choice Awards</a>, does: it's a category to recognize "innovation, quality, and impressiveness of storytelling in a game, including, but not limited to, scenario, plot construction, story, dialogue, and other major factors."</p>

<p><i>[Ahead of opening submissions for the 2013 Festival, IGF Chairman Brandon Boyer goes in-depth on the shifts in policy and rules for this year's 15th anniversary IGF experience, and the ethos and considerations behind them.]</i></p>

<p>Hello everyone, and a fine hallo to you, as we approach the opening of <a href="http://www.igf.com">the 2013 Independent Games Festival</a>. If you're playing along at home, you'll note that this is officially the 15th edition of the IGF, a remarkable landmark that puts into perspective just how far the business and culture of independent games has come since its 1999 debut (see the <a href="http://www.igf.com/1999igfgallery.html">photos of that year's winners</a> to drive the point home -- also, should we bring back the giant novelty check?).</p>

<p>As you know, each year we take some time following the ceremony to consider how best to improve and evolve the Festival in preparation for the next. It's a discussion we hold along with the community that has brought changes in previous years such as our two-tiered judge and jury system, and this year we'll be introducing a number of new changes as well.</p>

<p>Let's kick off the list of changes we're making this year with the one that most directly affects our entrants:</p>

<p><u><b>We'll be opening IGF submissions a bit later than our usual schedule.</b></u></p>

<p>Traditionally, we open submissions for the festival around this time (mid-June). This year, we're giving our entry and judging backend a major upgrade, so we'll be officially opening our submissions in late July. And though our submissions are usually very light until much closer to the deadline, we're mentioning this change so you can begin planning now. </p>

<p>Our deadline dates, however, will not change: submissions will close on October 17th for the Main Competition and October 31st for Student. We think you'll appreciate the new features that this short delay will bring -- we'll have more details on those as we get closer to opening back up.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2012.php?id=53"><em>Fez</em></a> and its lead developer Phil Fish make headlines again after the game was chosen by a jury of his peers for the win. Fish was most recently thrust into the limelight as the central focus of the hit documentary at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, Indie Game: The Movie, which also screened earlier in the week at GDC.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, developer Daniel Benmergui received the Nuovo Award and a $5,000 prize for his comic strip-based narrative game, <a href="http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2012.php?id=323"><em>Storyteller</em></a>.  The Nuovo Award honors abstract, shortform, and unconventional game development which "advances the medium and the way we think about games." <em>Storyteller</em> lets the player drop characters into given story panels, where they react according to their personality traits.</p>

<p>Other IGF award recipients for 2012 include thechineseroom's haunting first-person experiential adventure, <a href="http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2012.php?id=452"><em>Dear Esther</em></a>, which won the award for Excellence in Visual Art for its stunning environments. Demruth's mind-bending puzzle game <a href="http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2012.php?id=359"><em>Antichamber</em></a> earned the award for Technical Excellence for its creative distortions of time and space, and Mossmouth's update of 2D platformer <a href="http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2012.php?id=279"><em>Spelunky</em></a>, which custom creates new levels each time it is played, took the award for Excellence in Design.  In addition, Amanita Design's point and click exploration game <a href="http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2012.php?id=83"><em>Botanicula</em></a> received the award for Excellence in Audio with its original soundtrack and sound effects, created by Czech alternative band DVA.  </p>

<p>Rounding out the winners list were the recipients of the award for Best Mobile Game which went to Swedish developer Simogo for its rhythmical puzzle game, <a href="http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2012.php?id=209"><em>Beat Sneak Bandit</em></a>, Best Student Game award winners, and CMU Entertainment Technology Center/Coco & Co for its game <a href="http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2012.php?id=786"><em>Way</em></a>. Finally, Mode 7's Audience Award winner <a href="http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2012.php?id=118"><em>Frozen Synapse</em></a> was chosen from nearly 7,000 votes from the IGF game-playing public.</p>

<p>All of this year's IGF games, including both the winners and the finalists, are playable at the Game Developers Conference at the IGF Pavilion on the GDC Expo Floor, which is open through Friday, March 9th.</p>

<p>"The sheer number of fantastic games submitted to the Festival this year was overwhelming, and selecting winners was as tough for our juries as it's ever been," said IGF Chairman Brandon Boyer. "This year's winning games are incredible achievements that showcase just how diverse and innovative the independent game community can be. Congratulations to them, and to all of our finalists and entrants for continually surprising and delighting us with their efforts."</p>

<p>The IGF awarded the following games as winners of the 14th Annual Awards:</p>

<p>To be part of this year's vote, simply <a href="http://igf.com/audience.php">visit the IGF Audience Award page</a>, download any of the games or demos that are currently publicly available (each has been marked whether there's a version for you to purchase or otherwise download). When you've made up your mind, return to vote for your favorite.</p>

<p>After voting and inputting your email address, you'll need to verify your vote by clicking on a link sent to that email. Voting will be open from now until Sunday, February 19th at midnight PST -- <a href="http://igf.com/audience.php">go check it out now</a> and start making your way through the games!</p>

<p>The Independent Games Festival (IGF) juries have announced their Main Competition finalists for the 14<sup>th</sup> annual presentation of its awards, celebrating the brightest creatives and the most influential game designs to come out of the independent community in the past year.</p>

<p>This year's finalists for the most prestigious indie game awards, each picked by <a href="http://igf.com/2012juries.html">a discipline-specific set of expert juries</a> after recommendations from almost 200 top independent game experts, are led by multiple nominations for several standout titles.</p>

<p>These include thechineseroom's experimental first person game <em>Dear Esther </em>-- picking up nominations for Visual Art and Audio, as well as the Nuovo Award and Seumas McNally Grand Prize -- and Mossmouth's procedurally generated platformer <em>Spelunky, </em>which was nominated for the Design and Technical Awards on top of a nod for the Grand Prize.</p>

<p>Other multiple-nominated titles include Polytron's highly anticipated puzzle adventure <em>Fez</em>, Mode 7's turn based tactical shooter <em>Frozen Synapse</em>, and Die Gute Fabrik's digitally-enabled folk game <em>Johann Sebastian Joust</em>, all of which saw nominations for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize on top of nominations for Technical Excellence, Excellence in Design, and the Nuovo Award, respectively.</p>

<p>The Nuovo Award, once again honoring 'abstract, shortform, and unconventional game development' of all kinds, also saw some standout games in addition to some of the above titles among its eight nominees for the $5,000 prize. These include Bennett Foddy's fiendish climbing game <em>GIRP,</em> Daniel Benmergui's evocative title <em>Storyteller</em>, and Terry Cavanagh's two-player puzzle title <em>At A Distance</em>.</p>

<p>Now in its second year fully integrated into the IGF Main Competition, the Best Mobile Game Award saw nominations for Tiger Style's sci-fi action gardening game <em>Waking Mars </em>-- also up for an Excellence in Audio award -- Simogo's rhythm-stealth game <em>Beat Sneak Bandit</em>, Steph Thirion's constellation-crafter <em>Faraway</em>, Powerhead's color-puzzler <em>ASYNC Corp, </em>and Vlambeer's fishing/shooter <em>Ridiculous Fishing</em>.</p>

<p>All finalist games will be playable at the IGF Pavilion on the Game Developers Conference 2012 Expo floor from March 7-9, 2012, at San Francisco's Moscone Center, as part of a week of independent game-related content that also includes the Independent Games Summit (March 5th-6<sup>th</sup>), and the IGF Awards ceremony itself.</p>

<p>The IGF Awards, where this year's IGF winners will be unveiled, will be held on the evening of March 7, alongside the Game Developers Choice Awards. IGF award recipients will receive $60,000 of prizes in various categories, including the $30,000 Seumas McNally Grand Prize.</p>

<p>While some games were discussed at great length, others found themselves nominated essentially on silent, unanimous nods from the jurists -- either way, presented below is a collection of some of the more interesting comments about this year's nominated games from all of our various juries.</p>

<p><u><strong><a href="http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2012.php?id=359">Antichamber</a></strong></u></p>

<p>"A lot of what <em>Antichamber</em> does to mess with your head is explicitly subvert all the expectations you have when playing a first person game; it's cutting across the UDK grain and can't have been easy."</p>

<p>"[What] impresses me... is how the tech seems to be directly influencing the game design and art style rather than just being used to achieve a given goal."</p>

<p><u><strong><a href="http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2012.php?id=273">ASYNC Corp</a></strong></u></p>

<p>"Very satisfying, and strategies emerge really organically as you play with it, much like <em>Tetris</em>, instead of being things you are told and then try to learn..."</p>

<p>"This is one of those games where once you've played a lot, and you truly 'get it', it gets really, really good."</p>

<p><u><strong><a href="http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2012.php?id=173">At a Distance</a></strong></u></p>

<p>"A successful experiment... truly experimental and beautifully haunting."</p>

<p><u><strong><a href="http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2012.php?id=7">Atom Zombie Smasher</a></strong></u></p>

<p>"This game has a nice progression and tactics on many scales that all work together. Playing the overworld kind of felt like playing a board game... I had to play this one all the way through and stop the zombie outbreak."</p>

<p><u><strong><a href="http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2012.php?id=209">Beat Sneak Bandit</a></strong></u></p>

<p>"In terms of gameplay, I never would have thought a game where there's a single, simple beat to tap along with could be so interesting... Does it 'flow' like most rhythm titles? Not really. Instead it asks the player to plan a sequence, tap along in their head in preparation, and then go for it -- like playing a 'break' in samba. It's a genuinely unique type of puzzle, with some great level designs."</p>

<p>"This one got more involuntary grins out of me than any other game."</p>

                              <p>Hey all -- a quick note to kick off the New Year: the 2012 Independent Games Festival finalist announcements will now be made on Tuesday, January 10th for the Main Competition, and Sunday, January 15th for the Student Competition.</p>

<p>The reason? We're taking extra time & effort to make sure that mobile (iOS, Android and other) contenders are given proper consideration in all categories alongside their PC and console counterparts, and aren't just limited to their own section -- the reason we integrated them into the main festival to begin with.</p>

<p>As anyone that's worked with pre-release mobile game distribution or has been <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/12/30/app-developers-skirt-apples-100-device-testing-limit/">reading the news</a> recently will tell you, it's not the easiest process in the world to coordinate, thanks to UDID complexities. </p>

<p>This is especially true on a large scale -- but we feel like it's one worth undertaking properly to give equal consideration to every game in the festival for <a href="http://igf.com/2011/12/igf_2012_reveals_visual_art_au.html">each of our standalone juries</a>. Apologies if this extends the 'waiting' agony for some, but we'll sure it will be worth it. Please contact us if you have any questions, and thanks again to everyone for their support of the IGF.</p>

to identify a shortlist for the new 'XBLA Prize'. The prize will consist
 of a guaranteed first-party publishing deal to release the selected 
title on Microsoft's LIVE-enabled platforms, including the Xbox LIVE 
Arcade service, Windows Phone, and Windows. The sponsor-supported prize 
includes full game funding to complete the title, if desired. <br />
<br />
The first honoree for the award, picked from one of the 2012 Independent
 Games Festival entrants from either Main Competition or Student 
Showcase, will be announced on stage at the IGF Awards during Game 
Developers Conference in San Francisco on March 7th, 2012.<br />
<br />
If the creator of the selected game opts to accept the prize and 
associated contract, they will also get access to IGF Platinum Sponsor 
Microsoft's extensive suite of first-party publishing services.<br />
<br />
This includes best in class usability, testing, and production aid to 
help complete their game, as well as the game gaining a sought-after 
'slot' to officially release the title on Xbox LIVE Arcade and other 
platforms.<br />
<br />
As part of the announcement, in a <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TedWoolsey/20111205/9035/Developer_Developer_Developers_.php">related weblog post at Gamasutra</a>,
 Microsoft's head of first-party publishing for Xbox LIVE Arcade, Ted 
Woolsey revealed a previously unreleased statistic - that "Microsoft 
Studios invests more than $20 million dollars per year to fund Xbox LIVE
 Arcade games", not including this incremental opportunity.<br />
<br />
This much prized first party funding and publishing contract adds to the <a href="http://www.igf.com/03submit.html">already impressive prize roster</a>
 at IGF 2012, which has nearly $60,000 in cash prizes, including the 
$30,000 Seumas McNally Grand Prize and will showcase over 30 of its 
finalists on the GDC 2012 show floor next March.<br />
