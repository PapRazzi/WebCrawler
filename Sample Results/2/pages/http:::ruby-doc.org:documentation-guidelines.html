        <h1>
          Contributing to Ruby Documentation
        </h1>
        <h2>
          Getting Started
        </h2>
        Contributing to Ruby documentation involves working directly on the Ruby source
        code.&nbsp; Your additions (if they are accepted) will become part of the Ruby
        source and distributions and you'll have your name in the credits for everyone
        to see.&nbsp; Cool, isn't it?&nbsp; But to work with the Ruby source, you'll
        need to use Subversion.&nbsp; If you're unfamiliar with Subversion, check out
        the Subversion Homepage or its book for more information.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" title="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a><br />
        <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/" title="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/</a><br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Once you're comfortable with Subversion (also known as svn or SVN), use your
        favorite svn tool to get a copy of the Ruby source code. The repository's
        address is http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/trunk - and that will give you
        the HEAD version of Ruby.<br />
        <br />
        If you are working from the command line, use the following commands (from
        http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/ruby-core): Check out the trunk as 'ruby'
        like this:<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ svn co http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/trunk ruby<br />
        <br />
        This will get you the HEAD of Ruby, which at the time of writing is called 1.9.
        You should also grab a copy of the Ruby 1.8 branch.&nbsp; When writing
        documentation always check that your contributions can be easily added to Ruby
        1.8.&nbsp; If not, you will need to submit separate patches for both the Ruby
        HEAD and the 1.8 version.&nbsp; Again, from the command line, use:<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ svn co http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/ruby_1_8 ruby<br />
        <br />
        To check your additions to the Ruby source, you will compile the documentation
        yourself, using
        <a href="http://stdlib-doc.rubyforge.org/rdoc/index.html" title="stdlib-doc">stdlib-doc</a>.&nbsp;
        stdlib-doc is a specialized tool for building the Ruby source
        documentation.&nbsp; As such, the installation process is a little bit
        difficult.&nbsp; For now, read stdlib-doc's
        <a href="http://stdlib-doc.rubyforge.org/rdoc/files/doc/GettingStarted_txt.html" title="Getting Started">Getting
          Started</a> document.&nbsp; Go slow and make sure you have all the necessary
        dependencies.<br />
        <h2>
          Style Guidelines<br />
        </h2>
        Because your documentation will be added in to the Ruby source code, it's
        important that it be properly formatted.&nbsp; Use the following guidelines when
        writing to ensure that your contribution will be accepted by the Ruby
        maintainers.&nbsp; It's a long list, but don't let it scare you.&nbsp; The
        ruby-doc mailing list is a great source of help if you're unsure about how to write
        your documentation.<br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Documentation embedded in code must be wrapped to 80 characters, including
            comment characters and white space.
            <ul>
              <li>
                When the inline comments are processed by rdoc, the hard-coded line
                breaks will be replaced with flowing paragraphs. But when viewing the
                code the 80-character limit plays nicer with code editors.<br />
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Use :: for describing class methods, # for describing instance methods, and
            use . for example code.
          </li>
          <li>
            C methods must have call-seq.&nbsp; This describes the arguments and return
            values of a function.&nbsp; For example:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div style="">
          /*<br />
          &nbsp;*&nbsp; call-seq:<br />
          &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          array.delete(obj)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          -&gt; obj or nil<br />
          &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; array.delete(obj) { block }&nbsp; -&gt; obj or
          nil<br />
          &nbsp;* ...<br />
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All documentation should be written in full sentences that start with a
            capital letter and end in a period.
          </li>
          <li>
            Separate documentation from the comment character by one space.
          </li>
          <li>
            Example code within comments should be indented 2 spaces in from the
            surrounding text.&nbsp; This will signal rdoc to parse it as a code block
            and apply the correct formatting.<br />
          </li>
          <li>
            Include plenty of examples.&nbsp; Also, include the appropriate 'require'
            statements in any examples.<br />
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't document the internal behavior of methods. Describe them from a
            perspective of purpose and function.
          </li>
          <li>
            Try to include information on every page of the generated documentation or
            at least a link to relevant information.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          Submission Guidelines
        </h2>
        Once your documentation is complete, you'll submit your changes to the ruby-doc mailing list as a patch.&nbsp; If you are relatively new to handling patches
        the article
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Merging-with-patch.html#Merging%20with%20patch" title="Comparing and Merging Files">Comparing
          and Merging Files</a> explains this, and be sure to read the next section in
        that document called
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Making-Patches.html#Making%20Patches" title="Making Patches">Making
          Patches</a>.&nbsp; You'll use 'svn diff' instead of 'diff', but the syntax is
        the same.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ svn diff &gt; rdoc_changes_to_some_module.patch<br />
        <br />
        Check to see if your changes can be easily added to Ruby 1.8.&nbsp; If they
        can't you'll need to make the changes to both Ruby HEAD and Ruby 1.8 and submit
        separate patches.&nbsp; If the changes can be easily added to Ruby 1.8, one of
        the Ruby maintainers can port it to 1.8 for you.<br />
        <br />
        Once you've got nice clean patches and your documentation meets the guidelines,
        post it to the mailing list.&nbsp; The list is fairly active and you should see
        a response within a day or so.&nbsp; If you followed all the guidelines and your
        patch was accepted, congratulations!&nbsp; Enjoy that nice warm feeling that
        comes from helping out an open source project.&nbsp; If there were some
        problems, enjoy the collaboration with other contributors as you work to make
        your patch perfect.&nbsp; That's fun too.<br />
        <h3>
          Questions? Comments?
        </h3>
        If you have any questions or comments, subscribe to the ruby-doc mailing list and post it there.&nbsp; The Ruby community is helpful and
        responsive, so don't be afraid to ask.<br />
        <br />
        Thanks for helping!<br />
