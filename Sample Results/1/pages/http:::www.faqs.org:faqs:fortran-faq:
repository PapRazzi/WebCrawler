Fortran FAQ

 Here are some answers to frequently asked questions. The "author", as is
 the custom, has appropriated posted responses as seemed apt. I have tried
 to leave attributions in, as correctly as possible. To anyone who has been
 offended by omission or otherwise, my apologies. I shall give priority to
 corrections regarding attribution.

 No one takes responsibility for any of this text, neither the employer of
 the "author", the "author", friends of the "author", pets of the "author"
 nor anyone else.

 Your mileage WILL vary.

 A good place to look for FAQ's is:

    host:       rtfm.mit.edu
    directory:  /pub/usenet

 If you have comments/suggestions/edit proposals please send them to me
 (keith.bierman@eng.sun.com). I do not promise to accept 'em. I encourage
 others to make better FAQ lists, so I can retire this one.

 The structure of the current list has been modified from previous versions
 in an attempt to group related questions according to their topic, and to
 maintain consistency with the new order.  Let the author know if any
 inconsistencies have been introduced by the revision. &lt;William B. Clodius
 contributed the reorganization&gt; A more recent reorganization, and htmlization
 (which is what this ascii text is derived from) thanks to Abraham Agay.

    2.1.2) What is the best (FORTRAN 77) compiler for a PC? 

    2.1.3) What is the best Fortran for... 

    2.1.4) What Fortran 90/95 compilers/translators are available? 

    2.1.5) Tell me about Parallel Fortran dialects, what are they, etc. 

    See also:

           2.2.6) What is preprocessing, how can it help? How can it hurt? 

           3.1.4) For whatever reasons, I want to translate my Fortran into C.
                  What tools are available? 


  2.2) Other tools (pretty printers, lints, converters, etc.)


    2.2.1) I have heard of fortran "lints"; what are they, and where can
           I get one? 

    2.2.2) Are there pretty printers for FORTRAN? Flowchart generators? 

    2.2.3) Is there a WEB for Fortran (and what is WEB anyway)?

1.1) The language(s) and its(their) development


1.1.0) How should one spell FORTRAN/Fortran?

       FORTRAN is generally the preferred spelling for discussions
       of versions of the language prior to the current one ("90").
       Fortran is the spelling chosen by X3J3 and WG5.
       In this document a feeble effort has been made to capitalize
       accordingly (e.g. vast existing software ... FORTRAN vs.
       generic Fortran to mean all versions of the standard,
       and specifically the modern dialect, ISO 1539:1991).


       ---------------------------------------
       ~From: <A HREF="mailto:walt@fortran.com">walt@fortran.com</A> (Walt Brainerd)
       ---------------------------------------

       There was an effort to "standardize" on spelling of programming
       languages just after F77 became a standard.  The rule: if you say
       the letters, it is all caps (APL); if you pronounce it as a word,
       it is not (Cobol, Fortran, Ada).  See, for example the definitive
       article describing Fortran 77 in the Oct 1978 issue of the Comm.
       of the ACM.  The timing was such that FORTRAN got put on the
       standard itself, though many always after that have referred to
       it as Fortran 77.  Of course, there are those who think it is
       not truly Fortran if not written with all caps.

&lt;ed note&gt;

       ISO 1539:1991 and its ANSI counterpart X3.198-1992 consistently
       employ the spelling "Fortran" to refer to the language being
       defined. Reference(s) to the older version employ "small caps"
       for the "ORTRAN" characters.

1.1.2) How does Fortran 90 relate to FORTRAN '77?

       With a few minor exceptions, Fortran 90 is a superset of
       X3.9-1978 FORTRAN.

       But this does not mean that all "77" codes will port sans changes.
       Many (if not most) programmers employed constructs beyond the '77
       standard, or rely on unspecified behavior (say, assuming that an
       OPEN of an existing file will position the file pointer to just
       past the last record already written) which has changed (that is
       to say, has become specified).

       This leads to the obvious question, what is new in Fortran 90?

       A complete answer would require considerable text.
       Some of the most obvious additions are:

          1) array notation (operators, etc.)
          2) dynamic memory allocation
          3) derived types and operator overloading
          4) keyword argument passing, INTENT (in, out, inout)
          5) modules
          6) modern control structures
          7) free format source code form
          8) other stuff

       While it is always tricky to characterize the motives of
       a large group of people, I &lt;khb&gt; am inclined to try
       as follows:

       '90 incorporates two sets of improvements:

          (1) relatively minor fixups that *could* have been
              done earlier

          (2) relatively major changes to enable better software
              engineering practices.

       Sometimes a "minor" fixup has major effect, such as addition
       of free form source form combined with canonization of the
       MIL-STD 1753 INCLUDE.

       I further go off on a limb and assert that it was the goal
       of the *committee* to evolve Fortran in a fashion to enable
       it to continue to be the premier language for scientific
       computation.

1.1.3) Is it a Standard? Where can I get a copy of the Fortran 90
       Standard? How about electronic copies?

       Fortran 90 was adopted as an International Standard by ISO
       in July, 1991.  It was published by them as ISO/IEC 1539:1991,
       and is obtainable directly for 185 Swiss francs from:

       In accordance with an official agreement with the International
       Standards Organization, Unicomp is now able to distribute
       electronic versions of the Fortran 90 standard:

          ISO/IEC 1539 : 1991,
          Information technology--Programming languages--Fortran

       The money received from this effort will go partly to fund ISO
       activities and partly to recover the costs incurred by Unicomp
       in preparing and typesetting the standard document.
       The prices are set by ISO.

       The document can be obtained in three versions:

          1. An ASCII version suitable for viewing on a computer
             terminal using any kind of editor.  Cost: USD 125.

          2. A PostScript version with a license allowing the
             purchaser to print n paper copies.  Cost: USD 125 + 10n.

          3. Complete source in ditroff with macros and software to
             extract and create the annexes.  The source constitutes
             a fairly high level marked-up document; for example,
             each program beginning and ending is marked and there
             are few low-level typographic commands such as size
             and font changes.  Cost USD 1000.

       I am quite enthused especially about version (2).  If you want
       to have 10 copies for your organization, and it costs $10 to
       make a printed copy, then the cost to make the 10 copies would
       be $125 + $200, or just $32.50 per copy, which is a substantial
       savings over purchasing paper copies.

       Versions (1) and (3) will be accompanied by a license restricting
       use to one CPU and prohibiting copying, except for backup purposes,
       etc. The version (2) license will prohibit distributing any of the
       printed copies outside of the purchasing organization.

       If you have special requirements, such as wanting to distribute
       a copy with each version of your compiler or using the source
       as a part of your documentation, we can make special arrangements,
       subject to the approval of the ISO.  Please advise me of your
       requirements and we can work up a proposal together.

       ISO and Unicomp think this will provide the oft requested access
       to the standard in electronic form. This is the first time this
       is being tried, so we hope that organizations will be careful to
       observe the rules and encourage the continued availability of
       this and other standards in electronic form.

       Payment can be made by Visa or MasterCard, or with a check on
       a US Bank in US funds.  We &lt;unicomp&gt; will accept a purchase
       order only if the amount is $500 or more.

1.1.4) Who creates these silly standards anyway?

       Typically X3J3. X3J3 is an ANSI subcommittee dedicated to Fortran.
       WG5 is the ISO counterpart. WG5 owns responsibility for Fortran
       on an international basis. WG5 has previously tasked X3J3 to do
       the work. This arrangement continues.

       WG5 is composed of Fortran users, vendors, and academics
       from several ISO supporting nations. Delegates represent
       *their*countries* not their companies; so several delegates
       from a single company is permitted.

       ANSI rules prohibit multiple voting delegates from the same company.
       X3J3 is composed of users (aerospace, government labs, military,
       DECUS, railroads, oil to name a few), vendors (IBM, CRI, Sun,
       Convex, DEC, UNISYS, to name a few) and the odd academic
       (oxford, yale, liverpool, to name a couple).
       Members need not be US citizens nor must their company be US
       domiciled.  Being a member of a standards group is typically
       involves non-trivial work.
       To be effective, one should plan on at least 8 weeks of time
       per year (those who are really doing the hard work do far more).
       This time commitment is typically far more expensive than the
       travel and membership costs.

       X3J3 meetings are open to the public. There are typically 4
       meetings a year, typically 3 are in the US and 1 *may* be
       overseas (to precede or follow the WG5 plenary session).
       Membership fees are levied by ANSI, and are on the near order
       of $600 ($300ish cast as an ISO "tax", but mandatory for all).
       In addition, attendees to a particular X3J3 meeting pay a
       "meeting fee" which covers reproduction costs, snacks and etc.
       The meeting fee has been about $100 for the last several meetings.

       WG5 has established various goals and targets for future work.
       Roughly speaking 5yrs rather than 13years are the targets for
       future work.

       Current work projects include cleanup and interpretations
       of Fortran (90), features for future versions of the standard
       (e.g.  parallel processing, "object-oriented" technologies, etc.).
       In addition to work done directly by X3J3, there is work on
       standardized modules, and OS bindings taking place in other
       organizations. X3J3 would like to keep track of such efforts,
       those involved are invited to inform X3J3 early in their
       development efforts if possible. X3J3 is currently working
       with X3H5, DIN (varying string character) and tracking the
       efforts of HPFF.

       New members are always welcome. Visitors are also; though it
       is very hard to get a good grip on things in only one meeting!

1.2.4) What are good Subsets of Fortran?

One is F:

       Announcing the first book on the F programming language
       -------------------------------------------------------

       "The F programming Language", by Michael Metcalf and John Reid,
       Oxford University Press, Oxford and New York, 1996,
       ISBN 0-19-850026-2, (about $US30 or 16.95 pounds sterling).

       The F programming language is a dramatic new development in
       scientific programming. Building on the well-established strengths
       of the Fortran family of languages, it is carefully crafted to be
       both safe and regular, whilst retaining the enormously powerful
       numerical capabilities of its parent language, Fortran 90, as well
       as its data abstraction capability. Thus, an array syntax becomes
       available as part of a medium-size, widely-available language for
       the first time. In this respect, the language is clearly superior
       to older ones such as Pascal, C, and Basic.

       F is ideally suited for teaching as a first programming language,
       and provides a smooth path into both Fortran 90 and High Performance
       Fortran (it is a subset of both).

       In the absence of a formal standard for F, this book is the defining
       document for the language, setting out the complete syntax and
       semantics of the language in a readable but thorough way.
       It is essential reading for all F practitioners.

       Compilers for F are available from Imagine1 for Windows 95, Linux
       and some Unix platforms, with Windows NT, Macintosh PowerPC and 68K
       families coming shortly. The compilers are based on technology from
       Absoft,  Fujitsu, and NAG. For details see:

Another subset is ELF,

       Lahey has a native LF90 compiler for Windows and DOS:

          <A HREF="mailto:sales@lahey.com">sales@lahey.com</A>
          <A REL='NOFOLLOW EXTERNAL' HREF="http://www.lahey.com">http://www.lahey.com</A>

       It is particularly well optimized on the Pentium.

       Also on offer is elf90, a subset language that does not have old
       features like storage association, is designed for teaching, and is
       very cheap.  Also "Prof. Loren Meissner" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:meissner@usfca.edu">meissner@usfca.edu</A>&gt;
       can provide information, and possibly a textbook on this dialect.
       But in a nutshell, elf90 is said to be f90 sans What's not in Elf90

       To promote a more efficient and modern programming language the
       Fortran  statements listed below are not supported by the Elf90
       language. If you use  a Fortran 90 feature that is not supported, an
       on-screen error message is  provided.

          ALLOCATABLE*        ASSIGN              BLOCK DATA
          COMMON              CONTINUE            DATA DIMENSION*
          DO LABEL            DOUBLE PRECISION    END
          END BLOCK DATA      ENTRY               EQUIVALENCE

          POINTER*            SAVE*               TARGET*

       *Note: The ALLOCATABLE, TARGET, POINTER, INTENT, PARAMETER,
       DIMENSION, and  SAVE attributes are declared in type declaration
       statements.

       &lt;khb note: elf90 is, as I understand it, available on Intel
       processors only. F is said to be (or soon to be) available on a
       variety of processors, including Intel, SPARC and Macintosh.&gt;

   1.0 Fortran 90 and Fortran 77:
   ------------------------------

       Fortran 90 is, with very few exceptions, a superset of Fortran 77.
       The FAQ of the Usenet group Comp.lang.fortran deals with both
       standards, and may be obtained, like any FAQ, via anonymous ftp
       from:

          <A REL='NOFOLLOW EXTERNAL' HREF="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/comp.lang.fortran/Fortran_FAQ">ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/comp.lang.fortran/Fortran_FAQ</A>

          host:       rtfm.mit.edu
          directory:  pub/usenet/comp.lang.fortran
          file:       Fortran_FAQ

       It is also available on the WWW:

          <A REL='NOFOLLOW EXTERNAL' HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/">http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/</A>
                                         fortran-faq/faq.html

       The present document is an attempt to supplement that FAQ with
       some specific Fortran 90 information.

       Anyone interested is also invited to join the mailbase list
       comp-fortran-90, by sending an e-mail message to:

          <A HREF="mailto:mailbase@mailbase.ac.uk">mailbase@mailbase.ac.uk</A>

       The main extensions of Fortran 90 over Fortran 77 are:
       ------------------------------------------------------

       o  array notation (for instance, X(1:N)=R(1:N)*COS(A(1:N)))
       o  dynamic memory allocation (ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE, ...)
       o  derived types and operator overloading
       o  better declarations, and prototyping possible
       o  MODULES, allowing users to create ``storage pools'',
          or to define environment
       o  more of modern control structures (SELECT CASE, EXIT, ...)
       o  more of useful intrinsics (date, precision, arrays, ...)
       o  free format source code form


       ``Pure'' Fortran 77 is F90 compatible. Yet, it is better to convert
       it to a ``mixed'' format, acceptable both as free and fixed source
       form Fortran 90, which only requires replacing C by ! as the comment
       character, to use &amp; as the continuation line character, and to
       append it to the continued line, to remove blanks embedded inside
       constants or identifiers, and to check some intrinsics usage. Most
       of this can be done automatically.

       Fortran 90 allows the Fortran 77 programmer to write code faster,
       to make it more legible, and to avoid many bugs. For a newcomer to
       programming, it is an opportunity to learn a modern language, with
       most recommended features, and yet to be in line with scientific
       and industrial engineering communities where Fortran is and is
       going to remain for a good while THE favourite language.

   ----------------------------

       2.1 Compilers
       -------------

       There is presently no free full F90 compiler. However, some
       compilers restricted to modern subsets of the language are free.
       These are:

          ELF90 from Lahey
             for DOS 3.3 or higher, Windows 95, or Windows NT:

          F from Imagine1 for Linux:

       Compilers for these subsets are also available for other
       platforms, but presently not for free.

          of all end-blocks (for example, indenting a line starting with
          end, finds the corresponding if/do/module... and checks/fills
          in the right kind of block and a possible name), it has an
          automatic fill-function which breaks a line and inserts
          &amp;-signs (two if inside a string) when a line gets too long,
          different coloring for different features which is updated
          with every indent of a line.
          The most common commands are available via a menu.

          Somewhat expensive (CHF 210 ~ US$ 140 !) for instance, at ISO.
          Surprisingly enough, the identical, save for foreword and
          acknowledgements, ANSI standard X3.198-1992 is even more expensive.

   4.0 - Fortran 90 Benchmarking
   -----------------------------

       An interesting article by John K. Prentice appeared in the
       May/June 93 issue of Fortran Journal.
       He also gave a new one in the Nov/Dec 94 issue.

       I made some tests myself with LAPACK, and got a ratio of 10
       between Sun f77 and Nag f90 2.0 when no source change was performed.
       With an aggressive rewriting, especially using array instructions
       and intrinsics, the ratio gets down to 2, which is also that of a
       f77 [sd]axpy to a C one.

       On actual applications, this ratio seems to be much closer to 1,
       and even sometimes in favor of Fortran 90.
       On Sept. 7th, 1993, John wrote "I think there is in fact beginning
       to be a quite large body of evidence to suggest that most of the
       efficiency fears about F90 are unfounded."

       For Nag f90 on workstations, the effect of the underlying C
       compiler (gcc, vendor, etc...) seems very limited (less than 4%).

       With more recent F90 compilers, performance seems at least as good
       and often better than with the corresponding F77 compiler, for old
       F77 code. For instance, Lahey reports improvement from 8.5 to 14.1
       Mflops with linpack on a pentium between EM/32 and their F90 compiler.



   5.0 Announced, foreseen, and rumours
   ------------------------------------

       F: a carefully crafted subset of Fortran 90, meant for both
          teachers and professional programmers, by Imagine1 Inc.,
          NAG Inc., Fujitsu Limited, and Absoft Corp.
          F will be available on Unix and Linux platforms, the 68k
          or PowerPC Macintosh, and PCs running either Windows 95
          or Windows NT.

       FORTNER Research (formerly Laguage Systems Corp) expects to
          deliver f90 for Macintoshes in 1996.

   7.0 - Developments, related languages
   -------------------------------------

       7.1 - Standard
       --------------

       Work did not stop with the publication of the Fortran 90 standard.
       A new release is scheduled for 1996 (called 95), mainly devoted to
       clarifications, corrections and interpretations. It is currently
       being circulated as a draft for comments. A more important
       revision is scheduled for 2000 (or 2001 ? called F2k though C.Burley's
       F00 is a pleasant alternative).

       Some interim features are to be processed as "technical reports" and
       incorporated in the next major upgrade, now known as "Fortran 2000"
       and planned for release around the year 2000. The features for which
       interim technical reports have been proposed are the following:

          o  Floating-point exception handling
          o  Interoperability with C
          o  Parammeterized derived types and allocatable components

       However, the last of these lacks support in some quarters.

       The ISO working group devoted to the evolution of Fortran is WG5.

          URL:  http://www.etrc.ox.ac.uk/wg5.html

       Inputs are received from the National bodies (X3J3 in the USA).
       Documents related to the work of X3J3 can be found via anonymous
       ftp on ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu, directory x3j3.


       7.2 - HPF
       ---------

       High Performance Fortran (HPF) is a language for programming
       massively parallel architectures. It lets the user insert
       directives for code and data distribution among the processors
       in the (Fortran 90) code.

       7.3 - PVM
       ---------

       Parallel Virtual Machine consists of a library and a run-time
       environment which allow the distribution of a program over a network
       of (even heterogeneous) computers. It works with Fortran 77,
       C and to some extent Fortran 90. One can refer to the article
       by Y-H de Roeck and R-E Plessix, and a set of example wrapper
       routines for the PVM calls is available as:

1.3.2) Fortran Market

       ------------------------------------------
       ~Subject: (SC22WG5.609) Fortran Market/WWW
       ------------------------------------------

       I hope all of you will be pleased to learn that the Fortran Market
       has established itself on the World Wide Web.  Our goal is nothing
       short of providing one place to find all information, products,
       and services related to Fortran.  The URLs are:

          <A REL='NOFOLLOW EXTERNAL' HREF="http://www.fortran.com/fortran/market.html">http://www.fortran.com/fortran/market.html</A>
          http://www.fortran.com/walt/fortran

       The Market is under construction (and probably always will be),
       but there is already some free software available (just some
       simple, but perhaps useful, things so far).  There are pointers
       to other locations containing relevant information, so you now
       need to remember only one place to find it all.  Much more
       information, particularly about products and servies will be
       available in the near future, but I thought you might want to
       have a Sneak Preview of what things will look like.

       Come visit the Market and let me know what you think of it.

          Thanks. &lt;walt&gt;

2.1) Compilers and preprocessors


2.1.1) Where can I get a free (FORTRAN 77) compiler?

       There are few such in wide distribution:

          o  f2c + any C compiler
          o  f2c combined with djgpp
          o  A combination of (f2cx + gcc + djgpp extender)
          o  GNU's g77
          o  BC-F77


;; One such is f2c:

       -----------------------------------------
       ~From: <A HREF="mailto:mwm@a.gp.cs.cmu.edu">mwm@a.gp.cs.cmu.edu</A> (Mark Maimone)
       -----------------------------------------

       Since there have been several requests for a Fortran to C translator
       in the past week, I'm reposting the announcement about f2c.
       The short answer is you can get f2c by anonymous ftp
       from:

          host:       netlib.att.com
          directory:  dist/f2c.

       -----------------------------------------------------------------

       Source for f2c, a Fortran 77 to C translator jointly developed by
       folks from Bell Labs, Bellcore, and Carnegie Mellon, is now freely
       available.

       F2c was derived from the original UNIX operating system's f77(1),
       and the generated C follows f77's calling conventions; on some
       machines, the resulting object files are interchangeable with
       (and behave indistinguishably from) objects compiled by f77.

       The main "advantage" of f2c is that it converts ANSI standard
       Fortran 77 into C without manual intervention, at least when
       invoked by a suitable script or makefile (that may need to
       exercise an f2c option to ensure that COMMON blocks are defined
       just once).

       The main "problems" are that f2c does no code restructuring
       (e.g., gotos are preserved) and that Fortran I/O gets converted
       into a bunch of calls; thus the translated C code doesn't look
       too pretty, and in general one would need to maintain the Fortran
       rather than its translation into C.  [F2c is not meant to displace
       the services of commercial vendors whose business is to convert
       Fortran into maintainable C.]

       There is a plethora of options, many of which exist to support
       different compilation environments for the translated C (e.g.,
       ANSI C or C++ compatibility, different type sizes, separate files
       for COMMON blocks to appease "smart" linkers).

       So far f2c (and f2c-generated source) has compiled successfully
       on many machines: Sun, Vax, IBMRT, Apollo, SGI, MIPS, and Cray
       to name a few.

       F2c has been under test by the net community for over a year and
       has been verified on the NBS tests, several large math libraries,
       floating point tests, even code for laying cable on the ocean floor!

       To find out about f2c, send the following E-mail message
       to netlib (<A HREF="mailto:netlib@research.att.com">netlib@research.att.com</A>  or  research!netlib):

          send index from f2c

       Your message will be answered automatically (by a program --
       see CACM vol.  30 #5 (May, 1987), pp. 403-407).

       You will receive a reply explaining how to automatically acquire f2c
       source  (about 600K), f2c library source (130K), and supporting info
       (man page, etc).  Or you can anonymous-FTP to:

          research.att.com

       and look in directory dist/f2c at these files:

          all.Z --               250K compressed shar file for f2c
          f2c.ps.Z --            24 page tech report describing f2c
          index --               general info about files
          libf77.Z, libi77.Z --  compressed shar files for libraries

       Notes:  f2c accepts only fairly vanilla FORTRAN; vendor supplied
               f77's usually produce better quality code, and accept a
               wider variety of codes.



   More about f2c from Judah Milgram
   ---------------------------------

       I recently asked about running f2c with djgpp. Turns out to be
       easy and together they make a good Fortran compiler for PC's.
       Here's a summary.

       I started with f2c dated Nov. 1994 (netlib.att.com in netlib/f2c).
       djgpp was v. 1.12 (omnigate.clarkson.edu in pub/msdos/djgpp.)

       Use the pre-compiled msdos f2c executable that comes with the
       f2c release. Compile the libraries with djgpp, making the changes
       listed below. They aren't necessarily the most sensible changes,
       but they worked for me. Write if you have a better idea.

       Thanks to all net people who helped, especially Dr. James Lupo.

                                        #endif

          Easiest way to build libf2c.a is to go into
          the f2c/ directory and do:

             ar r libf2c.a libf77/*.o libi77/*.o
             ranlib libf2c.a

          (If you do it this way you can delete libf77/libf77.a
           and libi77/libi77.a)

          Then copy libf2c.a into djgpp/lib and copy f2c.h into djgpp/include
          And remember to run the executable with 'go32 foo'.
          Or, do 'coff2exe foo' to produce a .exe file which
          you can run in the usual manner.

       f2c is quite free.



 A ready to use package (F2CX + GCC + DJGPP) from Clive Page:

       I have packaged up a free Fortran77 system for MS-DOS into two
       files which are each just under 1.4 MB (to fit on 2 floppy disks).

       This isn't actually a compiler but relies on the F2CX translator
       to convert Fortran77 into C, and then GNU's GCC compiler plus the
       DOS-extender of DJGPP to get a flat 32-bit address space on MS-DOS.

       This sounds awkward to use, but works surprisingly well on most
       Fortran code that I have used.  Warning: this is free software,
       no warranties at all, but it works for me and some of my colleagues
       also say it works for them.

       The files are available by anonymous FTP from:

          host:       ftp.star.le.ac.uk in
          directory:  pub/fortran
          files:
                      ff77.tex        Instructions for installation and use,
                                      Latex format (22k)
                      ff77.ps         Ditto, but in Postscript (99k)
                      ff77.000        First binary file (1.4 MB)
                      ff77.001        Second binary file (1.1 MB)
                      tar.exe         DOS version of Unix TAR, needed to
                                      extract s/w (52k)

       Transfer the ff77.tex (or .ps) file in ASCII mode, the others
       need BINARY mode.

       In the same directory you will also find an electronic copy of
       a Fortran77 book which I wrote some years ago.  It's available
       in Latex and Postscript form in compressed (gzip) files

           prof77.tex.gz  (113 kbytes)
           prof77.ps.gz   (224 kbytes)

       Enjoy.

       Hi,

       since I read question 2.1.1 at least once a week in this newsgroup,
       I  would like to refer the asking (usually students, who need
       fortran for some  kind of project, but do not want to spend a
       lot of money) to your FAQ  like others do.

       Unfortunately I think that the info in this section is somewhat
       rather old. I would encourage you to make additions regarding
       the availibility of g77:

          1. g77 is now at version 0.5.18, it should be used with
             gcc-2.7.2, because of some improvements in both.
             It works quite stable and allows (in difference to f2c/gcc)
             the debugging at source code level (with gdb, newer versions).

          2. There are binaries in many linux-distributions,
             so you are not required to compile it yourself
             (which is not too difficult, but some work)

          3. Michael Holzapfel provided OS/2 binaries using the
             emx-port of gcc. He wrote, that he will try to keep
             them up-to-date for the next two years.
             These can be found for instance at:

                ftp.leo.org

             but many other os/2-mirrors carry them too,
             one might use archie.

             Because most students search a compiler for MS-DOS,
             I want to emphasize, that these are running fine
             under DOS and take advantage of all available memory.
             With the additional rsx-package they run also
             with win3.1, win/nt and win95.

          4. I tried the recommended  bcf for DOS some time ago and
             was not able to run any fortran code. (maybe I'm stupid)
             The system seems to be mainly for teaching fortran and
             is rather limited.

             Anyone who wants to compile and run real applications
             should g77 give a try, it's worth every cent.

       Someone asked for a cheap MS-DOS Fortran compiler for students.
       The bcf77 by Andreas Koesterli has a free student version.
       The student version may not be used in a comercial enviroment
       or to solve commerical problems.

       It's a version that writes a non-standard object format
       and requires 640KB.  If all input is in UPPERCASE, it
       supports the full Fortran 77 standard.

       The site is:  ftp.uni-stuttgart.de

       the compiler can be found in:

          /pub/systems/pc/lang/fortran/compiler/bcf77.zip

       It can be accessed via:  <A HREF="mailto:ftpmail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de">ftpmail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de</A>

       for those of you without ftp.

       Here's a quick and dirty translation (i.e., I didn't look in my

          BC-FORTRAN77 Version b consists of a compiler, linker,
          module library, and a resident runtime system that contains
          (among other things) a simple debugger.
          This version runs on a MS-DOS computer with 640KB RAM.
          A hard disk is not required.
          [The intent is to provide a compiler for programming
          courses in a simple manner. Similar compilers exist
          for the ATARI ST and the AMIGA.]

       Requests for another or a newer version will only be answered
       if they are accompanied by DM 20.- (check or cash) to defray
       costs (diskette, envelope, postage, and time).
       I can only send 3 1/2 inch diskettes.

       BCF is available by ftp from many places.

          host:       src.doc.ic.ac.uk
          directory:  /usenet/comp.archives/languages/fortran

       ...  There have been many complaints about bcf - but it is free.
       I recommend Lahey's Personal Fortran PF77L to those who have been
       disappointed with bcf.  I believe it costs US$99.

       There are many products, some are quite good. Few are free.
       f2c and gcc can be had for the PC environment.

       Popular ones are:

          Lahey (very fast compilation; excellent reputation for support)

          Watcom (touted for good optimization)

          MicroWay (support for odd floating point units)

          LPI (multi-platform support)

          MicroSoft (various good hooks into windows and such)

          Absoft (multi-platform support)

       It is beyond the scope of a faq to provide a commercial endorsement.

       HP
          announced on Nov. 11, 1996 its full ISO Fortran 90 compiler,
          featuring:

             o  Front End by Edinburgh Portable Compilers (EPC)

             o  Industry standard language extensions: Cray pointers,
                INTEGER*8, REAL*16 and DEC structures.

             o  Scalability - The same compiler runs on all
                high-performance HP computers.

             o  Binary compatability with f77 - object modules compiled
                with f77 and f90 can be mixed (same I/O libraries).

             o  Supports HP MPI (Message Passing Interface) for parallel
                application development. Support for HPF through Portland
                Group HPF package

             o  EUC and multibyte character support.

          Comes with a preprocessor, graphical-task-oriented debugger
          that can debug optimized code (except at the highest level),
          performance analyzer and incremental linker (links only
          modified modules).

          User licenses are priced at $1,495 per user license.
          The HP exemplar server user license is priced at $3,000.

HPF
---

         High Performance Fortran (HPF) is a language for programming
       massively parallel architectures. It lets the user insert directives
       for code and data distribution among the processors in the (Fortran
       90) code.

       Electronic copies of HPF draft specification are available
       by anonymous FTP from the following sources:

       minerva.npac.syr.edu    public/hpf-v10-final.tar.Z

       Fortran D is a precursor to HPF; as a commercial product it
       has been superceded by HPF, but several academic projects
       still exist that target Fortran D.

       PVM is a message passing library and run-time environment;
       as such, it exists at a lower level than the previous items.
       One might imagine an HPF processor that produced FORTRAN77
       with calls to PVM.
       There is a newsgroup on PVM.  It is available through netlib,
       and possibly from Oak Ridge as well.

          Hope this
          helps.

       Keith,

       Here is a suggestion for your "Parallel Fortran dialects"
       question (Q30) (2.1.5) on your (very useful) Fortran FAQ.

       Larry Meadows' information on HPF is largely correct (except
       for his saying "massively" parallel -- massively parallel is
       the one major parallel architecture for which HPF is not yet
       available), but I thought I'd contribute a few words about
       compiler availability:

       High Performance Fortran (HPF) is an extended version of
       Fortran 90 for parallel programming.  It lets the user insert
       directives into Fortran 90 code which specify the distribution
       of data across processors.

       Currently, most HPF products are not true compilers, but
       source-to-source translators.  Source-to-source translators
       are pre-processors that translate HPF code so that it can be
       compiled by a compiler without native HPF capability.
       They typically output FORTRAN77 source code, with calls to
       a message-passing library such as PVM or MPI.

       Compilers, on the other hand, produce object modules containing
       calls to either a standard message-passing library like PVM or MPI
       (as in the PREPARE compiler currently under development in Europe),
       or to a customized message-passing environment (as in Digital's
       HPF compiler).

       As of May, 1995, the following vendors offered HPF products:

       Compilers                         Source-to-Source Translators

       *PGI
       SofTech

       The first versions of HPF offered a partial implementation known
       as "Subset HPF".  Beginning in 1995, a small number of vendors
       began offering implementations of the full HPF specification.
       Currently, only the vendors marked with an asterisk (*) offer
       full HPF support; all the others support Subset HPF.

       The runtime performance of HPF codes varies widely from vendor
       to vendor.  The best-performing HPF products achieve performance
       comparable to hand-optimized PVM code.

2.2) Other tools (pretty printers, lints, etc.)



2.2.1) I have heard of fortran "lints" what are they, and where can
       I get one?

          o  lgrind


   What are Fortran "lints"?
   -------------------------
       Fortran compilers are not required (and most do not) to protect
       users from themselves, that is to say:

          call sub(1)
          ...
          subroutine sub(i)
          i=i+10
          return
          end

       Is non-standard complying but the compiler need not tell you
       about it. Arguably worse, the compiler can produce any result
       it deems fit, up to and including the start of world war III
       (assuming the right optional hardware has been installed).

       Fortran lint programs focus on searching out programming errors
       (or likely errors) and alerting the user.

       There are a wide variety of commercial and pd products.

       You may want to mention f2c followed by an ANSI C compiler as
       a great free fortran lint.  I could not have survived writing
       fortran if it were not for f2c.  You need to know some C to
       deal with the error messages,  but that's not a bad price to pay.

       A very kind soul who wishes to remain anonymous sent
       me the answer below.  ...

       1. There is a prettyprinter (called TIDY) available via
          FTP from the SimTel Software Repository (primary site
          oak.oakland.edu).  It's in the directory SimTel/msdos/fortran
          (Note: the directory name SimTel is case sensitive.)

          Capsule review:
          does an ok job, sometimes has trouble with newer extensions
          (and even some Fortran 77 standard features).  Not too
          bright about making good continuation-line break decisions.
          Free, and available via FTP, so probably the quickest solution.
          Includes source (in Fortran).

       2. Greg Flint (<A HREF="mailto:afc@klaatu.cc.purdue.edu">afc@klaatu.cc.purdue.edu</A>) at Purdue distributes
          a program called CLEAN77.  Pretty good (higher quality than
          #1 above), also free, but must be obtained from Purdue (not
          available via FTP, not redistributable).
          Available for assorted systems: PC, UNIX, etc.
          In Fortran, comes with source.

       3. There is an excellent prettyprinter in TOOLPACK - probably
          has more options than any other.  Has trouble with extensions,
          such as long variable names.
          Free, comes in source form, in Fortran.
          TOOLPACK as a whole is pretty huge, and requires some work
          to install, but it might be worth it if you stick to pretty
          much standard Fortran. Distributed commercially for a fee
          by NAG, who may have a new, improved version that is better
          than the free one - I don't really know.
          Available via ftp (see archie for locations)

       4. SPAG, formerly sold by OTG Systems (about $1000 for MS-DOS,
          more for Unix). Its main function is to restructure GOTOs
          into IF-THEN-ELSEs, but it also prettyprints.
          (I think they renamed this within the past year).

   TOOLPACK
   --------

       -------------------------------------------------------------
       ~From: "John D.  McCalpin" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mccalpin@perelandra.cms.udel.edu">mccalpin@perelandra.cms.udel.edu</A>&gt;
       -------------------------------------------------------------

       Not too many people use it, but you might want to add TOOLPACK
       to the list of FORTRAN "lint" packages.  Here is the blurb that
       I send to people who are interested:

       TOOLPACK is a large set of utilities written in FORTRAN to do
       FORTRAN code analysis and transformation.

       TOOLPACK begins by actually parsing the program with a fully
       FORTRAN- compliant parser and then does all the code transformations
       on the parse and comment trees.

       This means that you cannot confuse TOOLPACK by silly FORTRAN-isms
       that can easily overwhelm more naive utilities (such as ftnchek).
       For example, TOOLPACK correctly handles statements such as:

             D O U B L E  P R E C I S I O N A(100,100)
             doubleprecision fred

             DO I = 1.2
             READ(I,J) = 10.


       The usual interface to TOOLPACK is a set of 'csh' scripts that
       run the various TOOLPACK utilities to do specific tasks.

       The ones you will find most useful are: pol, polx, apt, dapt,
       decs, getlst, and discard.  These are the prettyprinter,
       precision converter, declaration standardizer, and some
       necessary utilities. See below for more details.

       By aware that TOOLPACK is *very* rigorous about the FORTRAN-77
       standard.  You may or may not consider this an advantage.

       The scripts are described by the 'scripts' script, which delivers
       the following:
       -----------------------------------------------------------------
       In the Toolpack script summaries below, the section numbers refer
       to the Unix environment Users' Guide where more detailed information
       can be found.  To obtain on-line information about a script's usage,
       type its name without any arguments.


       FORTRAN Analysis Facilities

          getlst   Produce a listing showing statement and token numbers.
                   Report lexical scanning warnings and errors. (3.1.1)

                  the program.  Examples of information the user may
                  request are COMMON block usage, symbol attributes,
                  and a graph of subprogram calls. (3.1.5)

          inst    Instrument a FORTRAN program so that the instrumented
                  program, when executed, produces information about

          rundoc  Execute a program instrumented by inst and, in a
                  user-supplied report template, place information
                  derived from dynamic analysis to assist in documenting
                  the program.  For example, the user may determine the
                  frequency of execution of program segments. (3.2.2)

                  standardized form. (4.5.1)

          ucs     Transform nests of DO loops matching certain paradigms
                  so that the transformed code executes more efficiently
                  on vector machines. (4.6.1)


       Miscellaneous Facilities

       ---------

       TOOLPACK can be obtained by anonymous ftp from:

          host:       perelandra.cms.udel.edu
          directory:  pub/Lang/Toolpack/

       The UNIX version is in the file:  toolpack.tar.Z

       Serious hackers will want the versions in the Distrib directory.

       The package is known to compile on Silicon Graphics and Sun
       machines, though the Makefile is reasonably braindamaged.

       You will need about 16 MB for the stripped executables on an
       SGI machine.  Figure on double that for compiling the package.....

          Have fun!

   NAGWare f77 Tools
   -----------------

       The NAGWare f77 Tools are a development of Toolpack/1 that raises
       it from a public domain distribution service to a fully supported
       NAG product.

       Large parts of the software have been completely rewritten and
       considerable new functionality added, although all the old
       functionality of the analysis and transformational tools is
       still there.

       First released in 1991, the current version,
       Release 2 contains:

          nag_apt     - Arithmetic precision transformation.
          nag_chname  - Token based name changer.
          nag_decs    - Declaration standardiser (can generify intrinsics).
          nag_fcalls  - Call tree generator.
          nag_fxref   - Variable cross-referencer.
          nag_libdoc  - Interface lister.
          nag_lvi     - Local variable initialiser.
          nag_metrics - Software metrics.
          nag_pfort   - Portability verifier.
          nag_polish  - Pretty printer.
          nag_polopt  - Polish option file editor.
          nag_struct  - Restructurer.
          nag_profile - Profiler and report generator.

       The tools are available for most Unix and VMS.

       These are just some of the many improvements and enhancements that
       we have made:

          1. The US Military standard extensions (DO WHILE, ENDDO,
             IMPLICIT NONE, INCLUDE etc.) have been added to the
             familiar Toolpack/1 language definition, but analyser
             tools still report all extensions to the ANSI standard.

          2. The tools have been substantially rewritten to increase
             the execution speed.  Notably the lexer and parser have
             been 100% rewritten to operate faster and give very much
             better error messages and error recovery.

          3. The user interfaces for the tools are integrated well with
             the target operating systems. Access is via Unix scripts
             (or VMS command language) that carry out complete tasks.

             e.g. To invoke the Portability Verifier for a mixture of
             Fortran and Attribute files, with lower case character
             warnings suppressed:

                Unix

                   nag_pfort -nolcwarn a*.f b*.atr

                VAX/VMS

                   nag_pfort/nolcwarn a*.for,b*.atr

             The script calls the semantic analyser for the Fortran
             files and passes the Attribute files straight to the
             Portability Verifier.

             Or, to call the Precision Transform and Declaration
             Standardise in one step:

                Unix

                   nag_apt -decs file.f

                VAX/VMS

                   nag_apt/decs file.for

          4. User oriented documentation is based around the scripts.
             A relatively slim volume provides all the necessary
             information to run the tools.  A step by step introduction
             to each of the tools is provided, with small examples.

          5. The portability verifier has switches that allow groups
             of less serious messages to be suppressed. For example,
             all warnings about use of non standard characters in strings
             can be switched off.

          6. The portability verifier can dump its internal tables to a
             "library file" that can be loaded in a subsequent pfort run.
             This can be used to provide a definition of argument passage
             in a subroutine library to check a program that calls the
             subroutine library. Library files are more compact and more
             efficient than attribute files for this purpose.

          7. Include files are dealt with sensibly by default, the lexer
             knows about the MIL-STD INCLUDE statement and merges include
             files. The polisher, by default, un-includes the included text.
             Nag_decs, again by default, does not declare variables declared
             in include files.

          8. Tools are distributed in executable form only. The installation
             task is therefore minimal.

       We are developing a new option to the Portability Verifier to aid
       in porting to Fortran 90 by allowing Mil. Std. extensions, names
       up to 31 characters, etc, without the usual errors/warnings.


   NAGWare f90 Tools
   -----------------

       These tools make use of the front-end of the NAGWare f90 compiler.
       Currently, only a small suite of tools is offered, but development
       is on-going. Fixed format input is acceptable, but all output is
       free format. Release 2.1 contents are:

          - Pretty printer (polish)
          - Declaration standardiser
          - Precision standardiser (Standardises precision of
            REAL and COMPLEX)
          - Name changer
          - Call Graph Generator
          - Dependency Analyser (Generates Makefile dependencies)
          - Interface Block Builder
          - Use Statement Annotator (Adds an ONLY list to
            USE statements listing imports)

       Also a module builder and polish options editor are provided.

       Release 2.1 has a full Graphical User Interface as well as a
       command line interface.

       Availability: Most Unix (now).

   lgrind
   ------

       Aside from code reformatting, there is the other meaning
       of pretty printing ...

       -------------------------------------------
       ...

       Second, on Q12 in the faq, about available pretty printers for
       Fortran...  Some time ago, I found a pretty printer called "lgrind",
       which converted a Fortran program into LaTeX/TeX.  This text could
       be included in a larger LaTeX/TeX file, or processed immediately.
       I chose not to use this because I found it was not the best use
       of my quota, but others may find it useful.

       Lgrind may be found using an archie search: archie lgrind ;;;;

       These more than pretty print, they optionally restructure your
       code (duplicating code as needed to tidy up strange GOTO lists,
       turning them into IF-THEN chains, and etc.).

       They have a product called "AutoFLOW-FORTRAN" that lists for $1,995.
       It claims to automatically document your existing source code.
       AutoCASE's number is 408-446-2273.

       On page 93 is an ad from POWERLINE Software Inc.  Their number
       is 800-257-5773, 206-623-9204.  They offer a product called
       SOURCE PRINT+, which they call a code management tool with
       "multi-style formatting with structured code blocking."

       They have a Fortran/Basic version for $169, and a Delux
       Multi-language version for $249.  This program is for
       DOS (MS-DOS presumably) Windows, and OS/2.

          Hope this helps.  Dave Appel


   Hindsight/Fortran Summary:

       Features include the ability to draw an interactive structure
       chart and display coverage, software complexity and performance
       information on the structure chart. There are also code tracing
       features, for instance 3 logic diagrams are produced.
       Common blocks can be traced through the structure charts,
       including specific variables within common blocks.
       Hindsight is excellent for documentation, code inspection,
       and bringing new software engineers up to speed on new code.

2.2.3) Is there a WEB for Fortran (and what is web anyway)?

       ------------------------------------------------
       ~From: <A HREF="mailto:ecmtwhk@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz">ecmtwhk@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz</A> (Thomas Koenig)
       ------------------------------------------------

       FWEB is available via anonymous ftp; use archie(above)
       to determine current location(s).


   As for the more general question, what is WEB ....

       WEB is a  "literate" programming system created by Knuth
       (he of reference book fame, and TeX fame, and etc.).

       It permits the programmer to write code and documentation together.
       WEB takes the "high level code and documentation" and creates real
       publishable documentation (using TeX or LaTeX) and compilable code.
       WEB versions for many languages are available.

       Some features of FWEB are:


          1) FWEB is a pretty printer.  Code is pretty printed by
             sending the FWEB file through "fweave" and "TeX".
             fweave inserts TeX control characters around the code for
             pretty printing.  Fweave also collects a cross-referenced
             index of *all* identifiers and prints them at the end of
             the code listing.

          2) FWEB has built in macro preprocessing, which *does*
             understand FORTRAN syntax and code layout rules.
             A line extending beyond column 72 will be broken into
             proper continuation lines.

          3) FWEB is multilingual: it understands C,C++,f77,f90,
             and RatFor.

       In addition, JED has a Fortran mode that is very much like the
       emacs Fortran mode.  JED also has a very nice EDT emulation and
       runs on MSDOS, Unix, VMS, as well as DEC Alpha systems.

       JED is no longer available from amy.tch.harvard.edu.  It is now

          ftp://ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de/pub/unix/editors/

       The latest version is 0.97-14.  A .gif image of JED is also
       available from http://space.mit.edu/~davis/images/jed1.gif.

       Despite the fact that the version number is below 1.0, the editor
       is VERY stable--- the version is below 1.0 because I feel that the
       documentation is not quite up to 1.0 levels.

       Here is a partial list of features:

          o  runs under Unix, VMS, and IBMPC (all versions)
             X Window version also available

          o  emacs*, wordstar*, EDT* emulation C, Fortran*, tex*,
             text editing modes

          o  C-like extension language called S-Lang.

          o  user configurable (bind keys, write functions, etc....)

          o  region highlighting (even on character based terminals!)

          o  Syntax highlighting in Beta test (even on character based
             terminals)

          o  8 bit clean, edit binary files too.

          o  rectangular (box) cut/paste

          o  backup and autosave files

          o  full undo

          o  regular expressions

          o  GNU Emacs compatable

          o  info reader* calendar* mail*, elm like rmail*
             (rmail new in 0.95 version) dired directory editor*

          o  automatic horizontal pan/scroll (configurable)

          o  parenthesis matching/blinking

          o  filename, buffername, function name completion

          o  Menu driven for novice users*

          o  incremental search/replace*

          o  sorting

          o  no hardcoded buffer/line limits

          o  multiple windows and buffers

          o  keyboard macros with macro query feature.

          o  buffer mode lines are configurable, e.g., display time,
             line number, etc...

          o  ispell* shell commands and ``interactive'' shell*

       * Note:  these functions are written in the extension language.

2.2.5) How can I convert an existing FORTRAN 77 program to the free
       form source of Fortran 90?

       Source code conversion program from ftp
       ---------------------------------------

       Many people who start to code in Fortran 90 prefer to do so using
       the new, less restictive, source form. However, a problem arises
       when wanting to modify old FORTRAN 77 code while sticking to the
       new style. To help in this situation, a source code conversion
       program has been written (and well tested) and made availble by
       anonymous ftp.

       Apart from the conversion, the program can:

          o  ensure that blanks are used correctly in the code as they
             are significant with the new source form;

          o  indent DO-loops and IF-blocks;

          o  replace CONTINUE by END DO, where appropriate;

          o  add subprogram names to END statements;

          o  change non-standard length specification syntax,
             like INTEGER*2, to the Fortran 90 equivalent,
             in all contexts (type statements, FUNCTION statements,
             and IMPLICIT statements);

          o  produce an interface block automatically from the
             source code of a procedure - useful to the library
             developer when wishing to use this important new
             facility with an existing library.

       The source code can be obtained by anonymous
       ftp to:

          jkr.cc.rl.ac.uk (130.246.8.23)

       When prompted for a userid, reply with:  anonymous
       and give your name as password.
       The directory is /pub/MandR and the file name is convert.f90.

2.2.6) What is preprocessing, how can it help? How can it hurt?

       Preprocessing often refers to usage of a Macro-prepressor
       upon ones source code prior to compilation.

       How can this help?

          It can make it easier to move code between machines.

       How can this hurt?

          It can cause difficulties in compilation of the processed code;
          most (if not all) macro-preprocessors know nothing about Fortran
          syntax and code layout rules.  So, a common problem is that after
          preprocessing some text may be lost past "sacred" column 72.
          Those working with compilers that optionally compile *past* line
          72 should probably employ that option when using a preprocessor.

       Common prepressors are: cpp, m4, and ratfor. Many sites have their
       own custom prepressors. Basic functions are:

          1) definition of a symbol
          2) conditional code selection based on a symbol
          3) substition of a symbol by its definition

       Traditional BSD Unix f77 processors treat a file named foo.F
       (as opposed to foo.f) as one that should be run through cpp
       prior to compilation "automatically".




2.3) Fortran Packages and libraries




2.3.1) Where can I get "foo" (some random package), older posts
       to <A REL='NOFOLLOW EXTERNAL' HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.fortran" target="new">comp.lang.fortran</A> etc

       ----------------------------------------------------------

       Use archie.  archie is an online database of what is available
       and where on the "net". Archie can be used either via telnet
       or by mail. For information about archie send mail to:

          <A HREF="mailto:archie@archie.rutgers.edu">archie@archie.rutgers.edu</A>     subject:  help

       And you will get back copious directions on how to use archie.
       If you prefer interactive experimentation, telnet to:

          archie.rutgers.edu

       and log in as archie.  No password will be required.
       The first thing you will be shown is a list of other archie servers.
       If one of these servers is geographically much closer to you than
       Rutgers, NJ, please disconnect (by typing 'quit') and use that one.
       To save you this step, here is a  list of archie sites:

          archie.rutgers.edu   128.6.18.15     (Rutgers University)
          archie.unl.edu       129.93.1.14     (University of Nebraska
                                                            in Lincoln)
          archie.sura.net      128.167.254.179 (SURAnet archie server)
          archie.ans.net       147.225.1.2     (ANS archie server)
          archie.au            139.130.4.6     (Australian server)
          archie.funet.fi      128.214.6.100   (European server in Finland)
          archie.doc.ic.ac.uk  146.169.11.3    (UK/England server)
          archie.cs.huji.ac.il 132.65.6.15     (Israel server)
          archie.wide.ad.jp    133.4.3.6       (Japanese server)

       I believe that all of these servers run the mail server as well
       as the telnet and archie server software.  (The archie server
       is a third way to use archie.  It's probably the best way,
       but it requires that you install software.)

       Once you logged into an archie server, you will want to make
       sure that all the information you will retrieve will be mailed
       to you. Type:

          set mailto <A HREF="mailto:userid@machine.foo.edu">userid@machine.foo.edu</A>

       where, of course, you will substitute your own email address

2.3.2) Where can I find coded BLAS (and what are coded BLAS?)

       The BLAS (basic linear algebra software) comes in several
       flavors:  BLAS-1, -2, and -3.  These can be described as
       scalar, vector and matrix-matrix levels.

       "Coded" BLAS are either hand coded in assembler, or at
       least tweaked for a given machine.

       Some vendors provide these, some are provided on the net
       (see archie) and some are marketed by various commercial
       organizations.

       In addition, it should be noted that BLAS-3 is very amenable
       to parallel processing. Done cleverly, this could be done by
       a network of processors over a net.

       DSS markets just such an implementation. Contact the folks
       below. The following material is their marketing blurb:


          DSSLIB is the fastest BLAS[123], LAPACK, LINPACK, FFTPACK,
          and VFFTPACK available for the entire SPARC hardware and
          software line.

          DSSLIB is based on LAPACK 2.0, but is backward compatible with
          all previous LAPACKs.

          Single-CPU optimization typically yields 2x-4x over Netlib code.
          MP computation yields significantly better than that, reaching
          almost half a gigaflop on a top-of-the-line Sun MP machine and
          exceeding even that on SPARC MP supercomputers.

          Interfaces are shipped with DSSLIB to allow users of IMSL/Math,
          Rogue Wave's math libraries, IDL from Research Systems,
          and others to optimize and parallelize their applications
          without making source code changes.

2.3.3) Where can I get mathematical software

       There are, of course, many commerical operations which provide
       high quality software. NAG and IMSL to name just two.

       netlib and archie (mentioned above) can be used to good effect
       to find specific freeware (public domain, shareware or mostly
       freely distributable source).

       In addition, NASA's COSMIC distributes some government funded
       software.

       One particular bit of NASA software, MATH77 a large math library
       created by numerical analysts at JPL is available from:

       program, you can use CADNA to see what results you get with
       stochastic arithmetic.

2.3.5) FLIB Announcement ... Freeware

       Date: Mon, 22 May 1995 19:39:41
       Organization: Kansas State University
       Lines: 93
       Message-ID: &lt;robs.16.0013A98D@ksu.ksu.edu&gt;
       NNTP-Posting-Host: s20.slip.ksu.edu
       Keywords: FORTRAN Freeware
       X-Newsreader: Trumpet for Windows [Version 1.0 Rev A]

       Hello FORTRAN People, This is the first general announcement
       of the FORTRAN Library (FLIB).
       One of the unique aspects of this code repository is that a
       considerable amount of source code is available for non-numeric
       tasks, .e.g.,

           string manipulation,
           time and date functions,
           conversion of numbers to strings (and vice versa),
           etc...

       Many of these tasks are among the most Frequently Asked
       Questions (FAQ) in the FORTRAN usenet group.

       The preferred (by me) method of accessing FLIB is through the
       World Wide Web. The information and code descriptions provided
       via the web will be more up-to-date and comprehensive, and it
       will be easier for you to maintain a stable link to this code
       repository if you access it via the uniform resource locator
       (URL):

          http://www.engg.ksu.edu/~robs/flib/flib.html

       FLIB can also be reached by generic file transfer protocol (ftp).
       If you have trouble accessing FLIB via your web client,
       try using a generic ftp program to access the anonymous
       ftp server at:

          godiva.ne.ksu.edu

       Login as anonymous and enter your email address
       (e.g., <A HREF="mailto:robs@ksu.ksu.edu">robs@ksu.ksu.edu</A>) as the password.
       The flib files are under the directory ~pub/robs/flib.

       The current scope of the code in FLIB is summarized below.
       Please feel free to send me an email message describing your
       opinion/experience with FLIB (remember however that this is
       freeware).

       Rob Stewart  robs@ksu.ksu.edu

       ------------------------------------------------------------
       Scope of Code Repository

       The FLIB routines are currently divided into five areas:

       CharPak

          This package contains approximately 50 routines to
          manipulate character strings (e.g., upper to lowercase,
          removal of specific characters from a string, macro
          substitution). convert numbers  to strings and vice versa,
          align/center text in specific columns,  plus more...


       GeomPak

          For now this package contains less than 10 routines; basic
          routines are provided to scale, rotate, and translate points
          between coordinate systems.  These routines are quite useful
          in a number of computer simulations involving 2 and
          3-dimensional geometries -- including graphics.


       RanPak

          This package contains approximately 30 routines to generate
          random numbers sample from various probability density
          functions (pdf) including a disk, plate, box, sphere, and
          unit direction vectors from arbitrarily oriented cones
          (NOTE: some routines call routines from GeomPak). All of the
          algorithms for random number genration are based on the
          discussion of Lehmer generators (circa 1951) in the article

          Park, S.K. and Miller, K.W.,
          Random number generators: good ones are hard to find.
          Communications of the ACM, 31, No 10 (Oct. 1988).


       TimPak

          A set of routines to access and manipulate the system time
          and date, compute the elapased time between two events,
          etc...  Since most of these routines are system and compiler
          dependent, you will also need to select the appropriate file
          from the Compiler Abstraction Layer (CAL) -- see below.


       Compiler Abstraction Layer (CAL)

          A set of stubs or wrappers for widely used but non-portable
          and non-standard system calls or routines (e.g., system time
          and date).

3.1) Fortran and other languages (Essentially C)


3.1.1) "Why do people use FORTRAN?, C is so much better"

       One should avoid such pointless arguments .... if you feel
       this way, don't subscribe to <A REL='NOFOLLOW EXTERNAL' HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.fortran" target="new">comp.lang.fortran</A>.

       This sort of question always triggers off a protracted
       discussion, the highlights of which are typically:

       a) FORTRAN and C have different semantics. A FORTRAN optimizer
          knows more about aliasing, function interactions, and I/O.
          A C optimizer has to infer or compute such information.
          C bigots typically have neither written such optimizers nor
          worked with folks who do it for a living, and are prone to
          dismiss such arguments as being petty and neolithic.

          FORTRAN programmers are often a bit more in touch with high
          performance computing, and are unwilling to bet that heavily
          on compiler wizardry.

          &lt;enter Peter van der Linden author of "Expert C Programming" &gt;

          In addition, ANSI C section 2.1.2.3 on Program Execution
          makes it clear that associative and commutative regrouping
          of operands is only allowed if it produces the same result
          as it would if the regrouping had not been done.
          Where it makes a difference is on hardware that produces
          an exception on arithmetic overflow, and the regrouping
          either causes or avoids an exception,
          that otherwise would not/would take place.  In ANSI C

             a = a + 32760 + b

          MUST be evaluated as  (a + 32760) + b  NOT as  a +(32760 + b)
          UNLESS the overflow exception will be the same in either case.

          Fortran is somewhat less tightly-buttoned about this, and
          allows the compiler-writer to regroup the expression and
          evaluate it in either order. Thus, in Fortran, whether you
          get an exception or not depends on the compiler, the level
          of optimization, and the hardware.  In ANSI C, it only depends
          on the hardware.

          Of course, compiler options, vendor extensions and the like
          sometimes narrow the difference. Also, some Fortran compilers
          do not take advantage of all of these features of the language,
          thus narrowing the gap in the other direction.

          On any given code, on any given system, all bets are off.

       b) There is a vast body of existing FORTRAN code (much of which
          is publically available and of high quality). Numerical codes
          are particularly difficult to "vet", scientific establishments
          usually do not have large otherwise idle programming staffs, etc.
          so massive recoding into any new language is typically resisted
          quite strongly.

       c) Fortran tends to meet some of the needs of scientists better.
          Most notably, it has built in support for: - variable dimension
          array arguments in subroutines - a compiler-supported infix
          exponentiation operator which is generic with respect to both
          precision and type, *and* which is generally handled very
          efficiently or the commonly occuring special case
          floating-point**small-integer - complex arithmetic -
          generic-precision intrinsic functions

       d) Retraining staff is quite expensive.

       e) It is sometimes argued that: - Jonathan Thornburg &lt;also
          responsible for misc. other fixups&gt;

          Fortran tends to be easier for non-experts to learn than C,
          because its "mental model of the computer" is much simpler.
          For example, in Fortran the programmer can generally avoid
          learning about pointers and memory addresses, while these
          are essential in C.

          More generally, in Fortran the difference between (C notation)
          x, &amp;x, and often even *x is basically hidden, while in C
          it's exposed.  For non-experts this makes Fortran
          a considerably simpler language.

          Because of this relative simplicity, for simple programming
          tasks which fall within its domain, (say writing a simple
          least-squares fitting routine), Fortran generally requires
          much less computer science knowledge of the programmer than
          C does, and is thus much easier to use.


       An interesting (pro-Fortran 90) viewpoint on this subject from
       a practical point of view can be found at:

          http://www.hp.com/wsg/ssa/fortran/f90prent.html

       It's called "Fortran 90 as a language of choice for engineering
       students", and was written by Dr. John K. Prentice from Quetzal
       Computational Associates (Email: <A HREF="mailto:john@quetzalcoatl.com">john@quetzalcoatl.com</A>).

3.1.2) Why are there aimless debates?

       There are some persistent individuals who would like computer
       systems to work in a fashion somewhat unlike they do now.
       It seems pointless to debate with them; the debates (in
       various groups) always take the same form and never result
       in meaningful dialog.

       One can usually recognize such by reading a week or so's worth
       of postings. Sometimes you may have to read for a month to
       recognize such. When you do, please try to avoid triggering
       (or responding to) such individuals.

       Many (if not most) newsreaders support a feature entitled
       KILL files.  As you recognize individuals, you may wish to
       put them into your local kill file.
       For example, the style employed by GNUS:

          (gnus-kill "From" "dweeb@place.ISP")
          (gnus-kill "Subject" "test")

       the first kills off all postings from the named individual,
       the second kills off all postings including the beloved
       "test" string. See your local NewsGod for details suitable
       for your local system.

3.1.3) How do I call f77 from C (and visa versa) This is quite
       platform dependent.

       For Suns see the FORTRAN User's Guide, Chapter 14.

       There is a package available from usenet which attempts
       to make this "quick and easy" for a wide range
       of platforms:

       It is on many other sites (around the world) too.
       See archie if you need other pointers.

       For some systems, you have to initialize a runtime system
       explicitly if you call a different language, and stopping
       execution from the other program may not work.

       : * How to call NAG Fortran Library with C (under Unix) ? *

       : We have a NAG Fortran Library on our machine but I do not
       : know how to call them in my C program.  Can anybody give
       : me some advice about how to do this?

       Hello, we have some programs written in C calling the NAG library
       (which is written in Fortran). There are a number of important
       things you must be aware of:

       1) Fortran uses a column wise storage of matrices while C stores
          them row wise. This means that when you want to parse a matrix
          from your C-program to the NAG (-fortran-) routine you must
          transpose the matrix in your program before entering the routine.
          Of course, any output from such a routine must be transposed again.

          If you ommit this step, then probably your program will run
          (because it has data to compute on) but it will generate wrong
          answers.

          B.T.W. if you have the Fortran source code (of any routine)
          then on some platforms you may use compiler directives specifying
          that the Fortran compiler must use row wise storage.
          Some platforms support these directives. However watch out with
          this if you call the same routine from another Fortran
          routine/program.

       2) Your Fortran compiler may add an underscore "_" to the routine
          name in the symbol table e.g. subroutine example(..,..,..)
          becomes example_ in the table.  Hence in the calling
          C-program/routine you must add a trailing underscore !
          Otherwise the loader will complain about an undefined symbol
          "example" while "example_" is loaded.

          However, check your compiler for this. For example the Fortran
          compiler on VAX-VMS systems does NOT add a trailing underscore
          (there watch out with the fact that the VAX-Fortran compiler
          translates everything in uppercase).

       3) Fortran passes its variables by reference. This means that you
          MUST give adresses in your calling C-program (i know, this is
          a stupid remark but it is too often forgotten (my experience ....)).

       4) Watch out especially with float's and double's. Make sure that
          the size of the variable in the calling program is identical to
          the size in the Fortran routine e.g.

             double &lt;----&gt; real*8,
             float  &lt;----&gt; real

          This is extremely important on machines with little endian byte
          ordening.  Parsing a float (C-routine) to a real*8 (Fortran)
          number will not generate SEGV but give wrong results as the data
          is parsed wrongly.


       5) Remember that the array index in Fortran starts at 1 while in C
          this is at index 0; hence a parsed array fortran_array[1:100]
          must be used in the C-routine/program as c_array[0:99].

       I do a lot of this.  The following is true on the following
       machines.  I cannot say about others.

             Sun 3 &amp; 4 IBM
             RS/6000
             SGI
             DECstation
             Intergraph Clipper (Apogee &amp; Green Hills compilers)
             H-P 7xx

       1) If possible, do not pass strings to FORTRAN from C or vice versa.

       2) Do not mix I/O on the same file descriptors.

       3) Do all your math in FORTRAN, and all the rest in C
          if at all possible.

       4) NEVER ever attempt to write the equivalent of a FORTRAN
          function that returns  a character variable in C.
          Life is too short for the suffering it causes.

       5) If you do ANY I/O in FORTRAN, you MUST use a FORTRAN mainprogram.

       6) FORTRAN always passes pointers. &lt;not necessarily khb&gt;

       7) FORTRAN passes string lengths BY VALUE in the order the
          strings appear in the argument list.  These do NOT appear
          in the FORTRAN argument list, but will appear in the C
          argument list.

       8) You will need to take care of nulls and blanks spaces
          explicitly if you ignor

       9) The Sun FORTRAN compiler used lex and yacc to do the conversion
          of a run time format from a character variable.  If you use
          lex and yacc either rename the variables and functions or
          partially link before you link to the FORTRAN libraries.

       10) FORTRAN symbols have trailing underscores appended.
           Some compilers require a compiler flag to get this.
           Use it! It makes the code more portable.

       11) Don't pass structures.  If you must access a structure element,
           pass a pointer through to a routine which passes back the
           element pointer.

       12) Don't forget that the storage orders for arrays is opposite
           and transposition is expensive.

       I currently have many lines of code with FORTRAN calling C calling
       FORTRAN.  It's not my choice of things to do, but it works well.
       Much better than using the wrong language for the task.  My only
       regret is that I'm forced to pass a lot of strings between the two
       languages.

       &gt; It is important that you know what's happening when Fortran
       &gt; and C access array elements.  But I never had to perform
       &gt; any "transposition" step in a program.  You just have to
       &gt; read the definitions the other way.  When the manual says
       &gt; A(j+1,i+1) I understand this means a[i][j] in C, etc.

       This is true enough, but there are times when you don't want
       to modify already existing FORTRAN and C you may have to write
       a transposition wrapper.

       This can be advisable for reasons of clarity (i.e. keeping the
       documentation the code and the math in sync.) and for reasons
       of performance.

3.2) Compiler and system differences



3.2.1) My compiler is mis-behaving; who enforces the standard?

       ANSI and ISO standards do not usually have a particular
       enforcement mechanism. Local bodies sometimes do.

       However, it should be borne in mind that if *your* source code
       is not standard compliant there is *NO* obligation for a FORTRAN
       ('77 and before) compiler to do *ANYTHING* in particular.
       In Fortran (90) the text in "constraints" must be tested and a
       warning produced (compiler option can be used to evade this, of course).

       Some (notably Guy Steele, with respect to another standard)
       have noted that when non-standard complying code is encountered,
       a compiler may do *ANYTHING* including initation of Global Warfare.
       Keep this in mind.

       When you do find a bona fide compiler bug, you are generally
       best served by reporting it to the *vendor*. If you neglect to
       tell the vendor, how can you complain about it not being fixed?

       When reporting a *suspected* bug be sure to be quite specific
       about the computer system, operating system rev level (patches
       applied if known) and *compiler*version* (and patches thereof).
       It is very hard for people to read your mind; but they will try.
       The attempts are often entertaining, sometimes helpful, but
       always an inefficient use of people-time and net-bandwidth.


       Also note that it is generally helpful if you cut down the
       example to the smallest size you can.
       Vendors are developers too; the tendency is invest time/money
       where one can get the biggest bang for the buck.

3.2.2) My F77 program compiled ok on a &lt;system1&gt;, but gives me heaps
       of syntax errors on a &lt;system2&gt;. What's wrong?

       ------------------------------------------------
       ~from: ecmtwhk@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz (Thomas Koenig)
       ------------------------------------------------

       Most likely, the program was written with a line length greater
       than 72. If your compiler supports it, turn on the option for
       greater line length (e.g.  -e is not uncommon) ;
       otherwise, split up the lines by hand, or via one of those
       pretty-printers/restructing tools mentioned above.

3.2.3) My F77 program ran ok on a &lt;system1&gt;, but on a &lt;system2&gt;,
       it just gives me strange results. What's wrong?

       -----------------------------------------------------
       Original:   ecmtwhk@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz (Thomas Koenig)
       Revised by: <A HREF="mailto:klassen@sol.uvic.ca">klassen@sol.uvic.ca</A> (Melvin Klassen)
       -----------------------------------------------------

       There are different reasons why this could happen.  Possibly, your
       program violates the standard in some way which is not caught by the
       compiler on &lt;system1&gt;, or in some way which the compiler on
       &lt;system1&gt; intentionally allowed, e.g., in FORTRAN 77,
       variable-names were restricted to 6 upper-case characters, while
       many compilers were extended to handle longer, mixed-case names.

       Some programs rely on the retention of values between invocations.
       Use SAVE statements for those variables which you need to keep
       across function calls.

       Some programs rely on variables to be initialized to zero when a
       subroutine or function is first called. Some compilers (VAX/VMS
       for example) exhibit this behaviour.

       Some operating systems (IBM's MVS/ESA and VM/ESA for example)
       have been observed to fill with a "zero" value the first time
       you reference a previously-unused area of virtual storage.

       Compilers on newer architectures often fill variables with
       garbage on each new function call. This is permitted,
       according to the standard.

       The solution is to explicitly initialize all variables.

       Your compiler may have an option to trap uninitialized variables;
       use that to find the trouble spots.  For example, the IBM VS
       compiler will do a static-flow-analysis, and report such errors,
       when you specify the 'OPT(2)' option.  Alternatively, if you are
       desperate, try to compile using a flag which forces static
       allocation of all variables.

       Another problem might be that the accuracy of REAL and DOUBLE
       PRECISION differs between different platforms; that can cause
       roundoff error to wipe out your results or your program to go into
       endless loops.

       Yet another (and much more subtle) problem can occur if a lot of
       formatted I/O is employed. The conversion from internal to external
       representations can introduce very significant errors; much worse on
       some platforms than others (doing correctly rounded base conversion
       is expensive).

       There are, of course, lots of other possibilities, these are just a
       starting point.

3.3) Language extensions


       The following three Q's and A's based on email from:

          ecmtwhk@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz (Thomas Koenig)



3.3.1)  How common is DO ... END DO

       It is very common; and of course is part of Fortran 90.
       Compilers claimed to *not* support it
       (much shorter list this way):

          1) Salford ftn77/Primos version

          2) Prime f77 compiler

          3) Microsoft Fortran for CP/M 8080/Z80 machines

          4) Fujitsu VPxxx UXP/M compiler


   __________________________________________________________________________
                                       


3.3.2) What are ENCODE and DECODE statements, and how are they translated
       to standard Fortran? How can I convert numbers to character strings
       (and vice-versa)?

       ENCODE and DECODE are vendor extensions to Fortran (invented in
       the sixties, long before X3.9-1978 added internal I/O to the
       language) which are most often used to convert data between
       numeric and character representations.  They may be viewed as
       formatted writes to (ENCODE) or reads from (DECODE) memory.
       The standard-conforming alternatives are internal write and
       internal read statements respectively.

       For example,

            INTEGER MONTH, DAY, YEAR

            MONTH = 7
            DAY = 4
            YEAR = 93
       C    FORM THE STRING  7/ 4/93 IN VARIABLE "DATE"
            ENCODE (8,10,DATE) MONTH,DAY,YEAR
        10  FORMAT (I2,'/',I2,'/',I2)

       The above can be translated as "write 8 characters, formatted
       according to format 10, storing the results in variable DATE, and
       using the contents of variables MONTH, DAY, and YEAR as the data to
       write."

       A DECODE statement would be used to reverse the process (extract
       the variables MONTH2, DAY2, and YEAR2 from the string DATE).
       Thus:

          INTEGER MONTH2, DAY2, YEAR2
          DECODE (8,20,DATE) MONTH2, DAY2, YEAR2
     20   FORMAT (I2,1X,I2,1X,I2)

       Conversion of ENCODE/DECODE to standard Fortran-77 is not difficult.
       The critical thing to remember is that the variable to be written
       to (ENCODE) or read from (DECODE) must be a CHARACTER variable
       which is long enough to contain the string.
       The first number within the parentheses (in this case 8) is the
       minimum length to use in a type declaration.

       Thus a standard-conforming equivalent of the above
       example is:

           CHARACTER*8 DATE
           INTEGER MONTH, DAY, YEAR

           INTEGER MONTH2, DAY2, YEAR2
           MONTH = 7
           DAY = 4
           YEAR = 93

           WRITE (DATE,10) MONTH, DAY, YEAR
        10 FORMAT (I2,'/',I2,'/',I2)
           READ (DATE,20) MONTH2, DAY2, YEAR2
       20  FORMAT (I2,1X,I2,1X,I2)

       Although the above example used integers, any other data type
       may also be used.

       &gt; &gt;
       &gt; &gt;Am I wrong, or is (Standard) Fortran90 really a not
       &gt; &gt;LL(1) language?
       &gt;
       &gt; FORTRAN is definitely not LL(1).  A good example is the difference
       &gt; between the following two statements
       &gt;         DO 10 I=1,10
       &gt; and
       &gt;         DO 10 I=1.10
       &gt; [the real difference is the comma in the first one &amp; the period in
       &gt;  the second example]
       &gt;
       &gt; The first starts a DO loop, using [implicitly integer]
       &gt; I as an index, counting from 1 to 10.
       &gt; [7 tokens - DO, 10, I, =, 1, ",", and 10]
       &gt; The second assigns the value 1.1 to the [implicitly real]
       &gt; variable DO10I. [only 3 tokens - DO10I, =, 1.10]
       &gt;
       &gt; Needless to say, you sometimes have to examine the entire statement
       &gt; before you know what kind it is &amp; generate tokens. One approach to
       &gt; handle this is to do something like...
       &gt;   call read_statement(line)
       &gt;   call statement_type(current_state, new_state, s_type, line)
       &gt;   &lt;computed goto based on s_type, etc.&gt;...
       &gt; where the statement_type procedure uses the "current state" and
       &gt; the input line(s) to determine the statement type "s type" and
       &gt; "new state".  The "current state" and "next state" represent the
       &gt; language rules relating to the order of statements. This solution
       &gt; isn't very efficient, and dumps a lot of functionality into the
       &gt; statement_type procedure. But it is a robust and somewhat easy
       &gt; to describe solution. There are undoubtedly others who could
       &gt; supply more optimal solutions.
       &gt;
       &gt; Good luck on your work.

       &gt; &gt; Could anyone give me pointers to information concerning
       &gt; &gt; the use of F90 programs as CGI servers.  I wish to write
       &gt; &gt; programs to generate WWW pages interactively. Has anyone
       &gt; &gt; done this ?  If so please contact me.
       &gt; &gt;
       &gt; &gt; I have checked out the FAQ and F90 pages with no success.
       &gt; &gt; I also know that perl is probably a more traditional
       &gt; &gt; language to do this sort of stuff.
       &gt;
       &gt; You may find that John Rowe's "Metaform" system does what you want
       &gt;

       &gt;
       &gt; lets users write and install their own cgi code in whatever
       &gt; language they like without causing security problems et al.
       &gt;
       &gt; I used it to implement a simulation of a temperature control
       &gt; system which takes lots of parameters and draws graphs
       &gt; representing the results. Get to it via the last line in
       &gt; the contents list of

       Recently I wrote fairly large cgi-driver in f77 and found that
       it was not very difficult, and for my application since the
       output I was putting on the web was originally created from
       fortran analysis programs, there were some particular advantages
       in the program logic.

       If interested see:
