size=3>Fortran 90 and later variants (currently Fortran 95) aid scientific and 
technical programmers working with vectors, matrices, and other higher 
dimensional arrays containing binary, integer, real, and complex data. 
Scientific programmers wish to write straightforward code performing 
computationally challenging tasks. Straightforward means code which closely 
follows the mathematical underpinnings of the task. It also means code that 
follows good programming practices. In addition, scientific programmers need 
excellent file handling capabilities to read and write data. Most scientific 
programmers rely heavily on numerical libraries, such as IMSL and NAG, in 
computing their results. </P>
<P>While Fortran 90 and later variants have made life much easier for scientific 
programmers than Fortran 77, the language still lacks depth in public domain 
utilities. The following package, ORDERPACK 2.0, illustrates the type of 
important but uncommon routines needed to complete the Fortran programming 
environment.&nbsp; ORDERPACK 2.0 performs both conventional sorting and ranking 
as well as the rarer specialized ordering tasks such as partial sorting, partial 
ranking, unique sorting, unique ranking, inverse unique ranking, etcetera. These 
partial sort and ranking routines can greatly accelerate many computations when 
users need only the m largest or smallest elements out of a n element vector. As 
an example of the speed, in 100,000 trials of picking the smallest 9 elements 
out of 500 total elements it took in total only 2.7 seconds for the the 100,000 
partial and unique rankings on a 600 Mhz PC using CVF 6.1a. A similar experiment 
involved 100 trials of simulating a random vector of length 1,000,000 and 
ranking the 20 smallest elements (keeping duplicates). On a 460 Mhz AlphaStation 
with Compaq Fortran 90 V5.2, taking care to increase stacksize, partial ranking 
by itself took 2.3 seconds, <I>i.e.</I> 23 milliseconds per vector.</P><A

size=3>In spatial-temporal applications one often wishes to know the nearby 
observations (say the <EM>m</EM> closest) subject to having these nearby 
observations also prior in time to the observation itself.&nbsp; Many of the 
ways of forming purely spatial neighbors such as those based upon Delaunay 
triangles do not function well in a spatial-temporal setting. However, partial 
ranking always works and can function with many more dimensions. Since the 
number of neighbors, <EM>m</EM>, is much smaller than the number of 
observations, <EM>n</EM>, the partial ranking algorithm saves a great deal of 
time relative to full ranking.&nbsp; For 7,000 observations, the partial 
algorithm saves almost a factor of 200 in terms of time over the full algorithm. 
Finding all the neighbors for 100,000 observations takes less than 8 minutes on 
a 600 Mhz PC, thus making spatial-temporal methods feasible for large data sets 
on desktop machines. This application was based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. BSC-0136229.
