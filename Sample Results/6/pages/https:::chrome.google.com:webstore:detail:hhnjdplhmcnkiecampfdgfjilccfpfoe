It’s a one-step, persistent opt-out of personalized advertising and related data tracking performed by companies adopting the industry privacy standards for online advertising.

Some things you should know:

  * In spite of the standard Chrome permission warnings you may see when you install this extension, this extension does not track or keep any records related to websites you may visit.

  * As more companies adopt the industry privacy standards (http://www.aboutads.info/), their opt-outs will be automatically added to Keep My Opt-Outs. As with all Chrome extensions, you’ll be asked to allow Chrome to update the extension.

  * Once you install Keep My Opt-Outs, your experience of online ads will change: You may see the same ads repeatedly, or see ads that are less relevant to you.

  * You can confirm that your opt-outs have been set at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/


Frequently Asked Questions on KMOO:

Why are we doing this?

We recognize that some users are uncomfortable with the personalization of ads that they see on the web and we offer many levels of control over this personalization. Two years ago we launched two ground-breaking innovations, the Ads Preferences Manager (http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/) and the industry’s first persistent cookie opt-out. Now we’re giving users who don’t want their ads personalized the same permanent, one-click control for advertising-related cookies across our industry.

Is there a downside to installing this extension?

Without a cookie, the ads you see on the web are likely to be less relevant and diverse. It also may result in less profitable ads for your favorite websites.

Will this persistently opt me out of every cookie on the web?

No, this will not opt you out of cookies that are not related to personalized online ads. Also, a small percentage of personalized ads also come from companies who do not yet participate in self-regulatory efforts, but we hope that this will change as users are more empowered with transparency and simple controls.

Why not block the ads?

Websites, ranging from small sites operated by individuals to large sites operated by corporations, offer you free content and services because they are supported by advertising.  Blocking ads eliminates the primary revenue source for most web publishers. We want to give users control over their privacy while surfing the web, not force small web businesses to shut down.

Why not just block third-party cookies?

Chrome already offers the ability to block third-party cookies (http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95647). But it’s important for users to understand that data collection and personalization of ads can also be done directly by the websites you visit — regardless of your cookie settings. Also, a cookie that&#39;s normally characterized as &quot;third party&quot; can become a &quot;first party&quot; cookie if, for example, you click an ad and get directed to the advertiser via the domain of the ad server.

Can I make individual selections of which cookies to allow and which cookies to opt-out of?

Not in the current version, though we plan to offer granular controls soon.

Is this available for all international vendors?

The current version is focused on cookies from U.S.-based online ad companies. We plan to include cookie opt-outs from European and other international companies soon.
