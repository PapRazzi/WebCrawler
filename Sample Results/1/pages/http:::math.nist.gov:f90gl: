<P>
f90gl is a public domain implementation of the official Fortran 90 bindings for OpenGL.
The current version is Version 1.2.15  This version implements the interface
for OpenGL 1.2, GLU 1.2, GLUT 3.7, and <a href="extensions.html"> several
extensions</a>.  It supports several <a href="unix.html"> Unix workstations</a>
and <a href="windows.html"> Windows 95/98/NT</a>.  It is also the Fortran
interface for Mesa.

<P>
<a href="http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> is a
software interface for applications to generate interactive 2D and 3D
computer graphics independent of operating system, window system, and
hardware operations.
<a href="http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/">GLUT</a> is
the OpenGL Utility Toolkit, a window system independent API toolkit
for writing OpenGL programs.
<a href="http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.mesa3d.org">Mesa</a> is a
3D graphics library with an API which is very similar to that of OpenGL.

<P>
The Fortran 90 bindings for OpenGL are an alternative to the older
FORTRAN 77 bindings.  
By using the new features of Fortran 90, they define an interface to OpenGL
that does not depend on any extensions to the Fortran standard and provide
access to the full functionality of OpenGL.  This provides the capability
of robust, standard-conforming, portable user application
codes, and increases the similarity between the Fortran and C interfaces to
OpenGL.  The Fortran 90 bindings were
<a href="http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=ftp://ftp.j3-fortran.org/x3j3/doc/year/97/97-227r2.txt.gz">
favorably reviewed by J3</a>, the US Fortran Standards Committee, and officially
<a href="http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.opengl.org/about/arb/notes/Meeting1.2/meeting_note_10-03-98.html">
adopted by the OpenGL Architecture Review Board</a> in February 1998.
