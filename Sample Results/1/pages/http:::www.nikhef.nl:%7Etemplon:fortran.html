    <H1>Information about running Fortran codes under Linux</H1>
<hr>
    I am interested in any information people have that could be useful here;
    please send email to the address at the bottom of the page.  As I am
    no longer actively developing in Fortran, I mostly add info here
    when someone else tells me it's missing.  So please let me
    know if you miss something here!

    Fortran is <B>the</B> language of the past, and one of the languages
    of the present, as far as physics is concerned. Hence this page. This
    page system was originally oriented towards the previous version
    (F77) of Fortran, but it now contains (as far as I know) all information
    on F90/F95 for Linux as well.
    <P>
      These pages are almost entirely specific to Linux, with the exception
      of the paragraph you are reading right now. For general Fortran
      information, <A 
	HREF="http://www.fortranlib.com">The Fortran Library</A>
      and <A

The information below is mostly about the compilers' capabilities.
<a href="http://www.polyhedron.co.uk/">Polyhedron Software</a> has
posted a table making performance comparisons between many linux
compilers.  Not all the ones listed below are covered on their
page, but they do have many different benchmarks and thus give
a better idea of speed differences in a wide range of applications.
<P>
The theory group at <a href="http://www.nikhef.nl">NIKHEF</a> has
done some comparisons as well, you can see their results at their

<A HREF="http://www.absoft.com/">Absoft Fortran for Linux</A> ---
This is the compiler I use. Native Fortran 77 and Fortran-90 compilers
are available. Both the Fortran-77 and Fortran-90 products support
most of the VAX/VMS, MIL-STD, and other common extensions.
Code produced by this compiler on Linux/Intel is on average faster
than all other compilers I've tested.
<a href="fortran/macabsoft.html">Absoft has released a version
for Linux/PowerPC!</a>
Educational discount, site license
available. Absoft F77 allows you to link in directly libraries compiled
with g77, which is a huge advantage for some people.
Absoft's F90 front-end is based on Cray's compiler technology.
<a href="fortran/absoft.html">Click here</a> for more detailed
information.
<li> <a href="http://www.lahey.com/">Lahey LF95 Express</a> ---
This compiler runs on Intel Linux platforms.
Performance is
near the top of the list for x86/Linux compilers (see the
<a href="http://www.polyhedron.co.uk/">Polyhedron Benchmarks</a> for
more information), comparable to Absoft's compiler.  The compiler
only differs from Fujitsu's (see below) by user-interface and tool
support, the underlying code generators and parsers are apparently
identical.
I gave an
early version of this compiler a fairly thorough test, and it
is a good product.  I don't know how their normal tech support is,
but I got answers to all my questions fairly quickly and in detail.
Their compiler is a good deal (pricewise) compared to many of the
others, on the other hand the other vendors have more extensive
tool support (hooks to parallel libraries, etc.)  If you don't
need all these tools, you probably can't go wrong with this product.
Anyone having more experience is welcome to contribute more info.
</P>
<P>
	  If you have this product and are having trouble running it
on a Suse Linux system, check Lahey's web site for a patch.

<li>
<b>Intel F95 for Linux</b> --- This compiler is in production as
of this writing
(September 2001).  A free license is available for noncommercial
users.  I don't have any detailed information on this product,
but the NIKHEF Theory Group
<a href="http://www.nikhef.nl/nikhef/departments/theory/fortran.html">
  has seen</a>
that it's the <b>only</b>
Linux compiler that appears to have effective optimization
for the Pentium IV machines.

<A HREF="fortran/pgroup.html">Portland Group Fortran Compilers</A> ---
PG has released High-Performance Fortran and Fortran-77 compiler products.
The HPF Release now includes a native F90 compiler. The Native Fortran
77 compiler is very similar to Absoft's. I think this product is quite
comparable
in quality to Absoft's offering, and you probably couldn't go wrong with
either one. <A HREF="fortran/pgf-comments.html">Follow this link</A> to

<LI>
  <b>Fujitsu Fortran Compiler</b> --- This product lives on since
 it forms the guts of Lahey's system. 
 A <a href="fortran/fujit.post">newsgroup posting</a> by
 Fujitsu claims that development of this compiler continues.
 However, Fujitsu no longer sells this compiler directly.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.compaq.com/fortran">Compaq (prev. DEC) Fortran</a> ---
Many of us remember DEC Fortran being the One True Fortran.
Wasn't really true, but it was a great compiler system, and
a version of that system has now been released for
the Linux OS on Alpha systems.
This is good news for Linux/Alpha people, since there were not many
compilers from which to choose on that platform (and no native F90
compiler at all!)
</li>
<LI>
<A HREF="fortran/nagf90.html">NAGWare f95</A> --- F95-to-C translator,
although
NAG would prefer F95-to-C "compiler". Inexpensive.
I know of some people who really swear by this compiler.
I tried the beta version and was quite pleased with it.</LI>
<LI>
<b>NA FortranPlus</b> --- Native Fortran 95
compiler.
In principle therefore also an F77 compiler, but a report on
comp.lang.fortran
suggests that the F77 support is incomplete. Our group has no experience
with this compiler.  I have yet to hear any positive reports about
the Linux version, but Alan Miller has contributed some
<a href="fortran/naf95-miller.txt">notes on the Windows version</a>
which are mostly positive.
Please consider submitting
a review if you are familiar with this compiler.
</li>
<LI>
<b>Microway NDP Fortran</b> --- 
Would have been the first native Fortran-77 compiler for Linux/x86.
Product development was stopped before compiler was fully working.
Don't let anyone sell you a copy.
</li>
<LI>
<b>SNI F77</b> --- This compiler was produced by
Siemens Nixdorf in Germany. It appears to be a full F77 native compiler
for Intel/Linux platforms.  As of March 2001 I could find no information
on this compiler and no vendors selling it; it appears to have been
discontinued.  Please contact me if you have different information.

<A HREF="fortran/f2c.html">f2c (+ gcc)</A> --- This was previously the
"standard" Linux Fortran system. Not native - f2c translates to C, and
true compilation handled by gcc. Thus this "compiler" should run on any
of the various Linux hardware platforms. Very stable and well-debugged.
Handles almost no extensions to the ANSI F77 standard. Good performance,
slow compilation, excellent "paranoia" results (certain compiler options
are required ... see the link above for more info). Debugging using gdb
is difficult, but is supported through an add-on package
(see the <B>f2c-stabs</B> entry below.) Available free of charge by ftp.

<B>Imagine1 F Compiler</B> --- <B>F</B> is a language which is a subset
of Fortran 95, and the latest release contains some features anticipated
for Fortran-200X.
It is not Fortran 77 compatible, but Jos Bergervoet reports that
one may link in object files compiled with g77.  So you can't compile
F77 code, but you can still use your old libraries. If you are beginning a
new project and thus do not have to be F77 or VAX compatible, and would
like to use both Fortran and modern language constructs, you may be interested
in this. I have no personal experience with it.

<LI>
The <A HREF="fortran/alignment.html">Alignment Info Page</A> talks about
the importance of data alignment in getting the maximum execution speed

machines, where you can slow down (or speed up) your code by something
like 50 percent by alignment effects.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
Linux-Specific Fortran Tools</H2>
These packages help use Fortran on Linux systems more effectively and/or
more easily.
<H3>
Compiler driver scripts</H3>
These scripts allow you to run f2c and gcc together and with the correct
arguments, without having to issue two commands. You issue one command,
which looks like a typical Fortran compiler program. It manages the separate
phases of f2c and gcc compilation. Slackware comes standard with a script
called <B>f77</B> (which I do not recommend), and RedHat comes standard
with <B>fort77</B> (see below.)
<UL>
<LI>
<B>f77/reorder</B> --- Wolfgang Wander at DESY has an alternate version
of the f77 script (the "standard" Linux f2c+gcc driver.) His version of
f77 fixes the bugs of the original (like not working correctly in Makefiles).
"reorder" prepares your code for f2c translation by fixing some common
standard-violating coding practices which f2c will not accept. "reorder"
has recently been upgraded so that the emitted debugger information is
in sync with the original source file. You can find this package at his
<A HREF="http://www-hermes.desy.de/ww/f77prob.html">f77
Problem Page</A>.</LI>

<LI>
<B>fort77</B> --- fort77 is another f77 replacement. It works very well
in Makefiles, and its compiler-option flags more closely resemble those
of typical Unix f77 compilers than do those of the Slackware <B>f77</B>
script. Thus, Makefiles from other Unix systems will probably work with
it (and possibly not with f77.) It also uses gcc flags which are different
(better?) than those of f77 when you turn on optimization.</LI>

<LI>
<B>yaf77</B> --- Yet Another f77. I don't have any information on this
script itself. Some libraries are included with this package that some
net people have found helpful in porting codes from other systems to
Linux.</LI>
</UL>

<B>fort77</B> and <B>yaf77</B> can be found at any Sunsite mirror, directory
<B>devel/lang/fortran</B>.

<H3>Debugger Support</H3>

NAGWare F95 code can be directly debugged with gdb, and Absoft's compiler ships
with its own fully symbolic source-level debugger. Users of one of the
various f2c+gcc packages can use the <B>f2c-stabs</B> package, which is
an Emacs interface to gdb. It has its own Fortran parser, and knows how
to translate the names used in the Fortran source so that gdb can find
them. <A HREF="fortran/f2c-stabs-info.txt">Look here</A> for a package
description from the author (Harvey J. Stein, &lt;abel@netvision.net.il>).
<H2>
Other Fortran Tools Available for Linux</H2>
<B>Forcheck</B> --- Forcheck is a Fortran 77 and Fortran 90 parser which
verifies the syntax of program units and the consistency of the entire
program. It has been developed by Leiden University in the Netherlands,
but it is a commercial product. The following information comes from the
Forcheck Group at Leiden:
<BR>"It warns for all kinds of anomalies such as unassigned or unreferenced
items. It produces listings and cross-references of all syntax items. For
the global program it provides a call-tree, a subprogram index, and cross-references
of procedures, i/o, include files, common blocks and even common-block
elements. Forcheck supports most Fortran language extensions of many compilers
and can be tuned easily by the user. It can be used as a software engineering
tool for small up to very large projects."
<BR>I have a copy and am generally quite pleased with it. I am especially
happy that it supports F90 and DEC-Fortran STRUCTUREs, so I can analyze
much more code than I could with FTNCHEK. There are still a couple of things
for which I like FTNCHEK better, for example FTNCHEK has more user-friendly
global analysis (it will tell you the line number and type of interface
mismatches which reside in different files, something FORCHECK cannot do).
Forcheck has a <A HREF="http://www.forcheck.nl/">web page
(click here)</A>.
<P><B>Foresys</B> --- a very nice static analysis tool from
<a href="http://www.simulog.fr/iforef.htm">Simulog</a>
in France.  Does many of the same things that FORCHECK does.
A nice plus is that code metrics are included; their value may
be debated, but they are included if you want them.
Also has a GUI; this is the only linux static analysis tool I have
seen (for fortran that is) that has a GUI.  Very nice, can easily
take you with one click to the definition, or source code, for a
variable or function on which you click in a source window.
A trial version is available online.
<P><B>Source Navigator</B> --- a wonderful tool from Cygnus Solutions.
Contains an integrated editor, cross-reference tool, "class browser" (which
treats DEC-Fortran STRUCTUREs as "classes"), a graphical front-end to gprof,
and more. It is now open-source; check it out at
<A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/sourcenav/">RedHat</a>.
Also check out a 
<A HREF="http://www.cas-gmbh.de/en/software/snav">
   support and extensions page</A>
as well as the <A HREF="http://www.cas-gmbh.de/SN-FAQ.html">FAQ</A>.
<P><B>FTNCHEK</B> --- FTNCHEK is a Fortran-77 parser which will make a
nice listing file, construct a subroutine call tree (a sort of flow diagram
for your program), and list all variables with their types. It also can
do extensive syntax checking, and detects many classes of errors in ANSI
fortran-77 code. Most F77 compilers will do none of this for you (except
for find the coding errors, if they are severe enough.) The FTNCHEK listing
file can be made to look very much like VAX Fortran's FOR/LIS output. Pick
it up <A HREF="http://dsm.dsm.fordham.edu/~ftnchek/">here</A>.
<P><B>NAGWare Tools</b> --- Software from NAG for transformation and
analysis of Fortran-77 and Fortran-95 code.
<a href="http://www.nag.co.uk/nagware/nq/contents.asp">More information
here</a>.
<P><B>The Fortran Programmer's Workshop</B> This tool can be thought of
as an interactive "make" facility. It has methods for organizing source
code into libraries, building various programs from this code, running
programs, and other code-maintenance facilities. There is a command-line
version as well as a new graphical version which uses Tcl/Tk. You can visit
<A HREF="http://www.ec-nantes.fr/F_Serveur/Recherche/DMN/">the
Fortran Programmer's Workshop Web Page</A> for more information. I have
no experience with this tool, as I am a diehard make fan.
<P><B>PlusFORT</B> --- PlusFORT is a very sophisticated package which can
analyze, beautify, and improve your Fortran codes. The package is quite
a bit more difficult to use than is FTNCHEK (see above), but can do much
more. It claims to handle all VAX/VMS extensions. I found that it will
accept things such as STRUCTUREs, but does not do much with them other
than parse them (sometimes incorrectly computing the size.) A free subset
of the complete version is available for Linux platforms. <A HREF="http://www.polyhedron.co.uk/">Visit
the PlusFORT Page</A> for more information.
<P><B>SNiFF+</B> --- A "source code engineering tool" which I know
 is in use at CERN, has now been released for Linux.  Note that the
version that you can download only works on glibc2.1 systems (like
RedHat 6.0).  I have not yet tried it, but here is what they sent
me:<BR>
<PRE>
Description:
SNiFF+ is the premier Source Code Engineering tool. SNiFF+ provides an
integrated collection of source code analysis, browsing, navigation,
comprehension, editing, build, and configuration management tools for C,
C++, FORTRAN, Java, and CORBA IDL developers. With support for Windows and
all major UNIX platforms, SNiFF+ enables developers in cross-platform and
multi-language environments to utilize the same tool set and GUI.

<P>
<B>Understand</B> --- Understand is a program-analysis tool for Fortran
codes. You run this program with your source files as input, and it constructs
a database which can be visually browsed. The tool appears to be best suited
for "understanding" your program; clicking on any entity (under X windows)
allows you to see a diagram of, for example, what routines call a particular
subroutine, and what subroutines are called by it; find all the places
a particular variable is used, where and how it is defined, etc. It also
creates tables of program statistics which can be browsed under a WWW browser.
A demo version can be downloaded from their
<A HREF="http://www.scitools.com/">web site</a>.
<P>
<B>asa</B> --- This is an output filter for your Fortran output files.
It looks at the Hollerith carriage-control strings in the first character
position in each line (those pesky "0", "1", and "+" characters) and converts
them into control codes understood by programs like "more" and by Unix
printer software. This code should also work on other Unix systems.

since September 1995. It supports the Fujitsu compiler, f2c and g77;
the g77 support applies
to Intel, Alpha, and SPARC platforms (you apparently do not need to
purchase a separate license for each platform). The Linux version is priced
lower than the other Unix versions. This information comes directly from
ISS Ltd and I cannot confirm or deny it, as I have no direct experience
