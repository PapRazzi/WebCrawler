          As a long‐term K‐12 initiative, the primary goal of the Greene Scholars Program is to
          increase the success rate of African ancestry youth in science, technology, engineering
          and math course work and to increase the number of students choosing STEM career paths.
          Our Math Tech Project is a year-round supplemental intervention including a Summer Math
          Academy for all levels of math ranging from Pre‐Algebra to Calculus. The purpose of this
          program is to ensure the student's academic success through extended educational learning
          and mentoring, plus build the student's self‐esteem, improve students' attitudes and
          provide motivation to help students develop discipline.

          competitions, with an emphasis on learning by doing. In partnership with local middle and
          high school robotics programs and the USC Center for Engineering Diversity, we want this
          program to become the first step in a STEM learning pipeline from elementary school to
          college to career.

          magnetism. K-12 students learn science concepts while seeing how science is an active
          investigation. We have a special focus on underserved communities and take 3-4 extended
          trips each year to Native American reservation areas. We've found our approach is
          valuable for Native American students in traditions that let children explore under the

          The Department of Computer Science at "La Sapienza", Rome, has become a focal point for
          young people wishing to acquire a sound theoretical and experimental preparation which
          will enable them to enter and participate actively in the fast evolving world of
          Information and Communication Technology. However, less than 15% of our students are
          female. To address this problem, we launched the NERD? program for female students in
          High School. NERD? is the acronym for the Italian phrase "Non E' Roba per Donne?", which
          translates as "Not women's stuff?". The main objectives of the program are to disprove
          the stereotype that computer science is for "nerds" and demonstrate the highly creative
          nature of the discipline, thus stimulating students' interest in pursuing their studies
          in it. A web site will be set up to share our experience and teaching material with other
          universities and instructors, and also to offer a meeting point for female students
