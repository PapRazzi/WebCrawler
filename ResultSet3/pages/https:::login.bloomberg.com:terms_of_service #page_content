    <h4>5. Fees and Payments.</h4>
    <p>BLP reserves the right at any time to charge fees for access to portions of
    the Service or the Service as a whole. If at any time BLP requires a fee
    for portions of the Service or the Service as a whole, BLP will require you
    to register and create an account. You shall pay all fees and charges
    incurred through your account at the rates in effect for the billing period
    in which such fees and charges are incurred, including but not limited to
    charges for any products or services offered for sale through the Service
    by Bloomberg or by any other vendor or service provider. All fees and
    charges shall be billed to you, and you shall be solely responsible for
    their payment. You shall pay all applicable taxes relating to the use of
    the Service through your account, and the purchase of any other products or
    services. Certain portions of the Service or the Service as a whole may
    require a prepaid fee ("Prepaid Fee"), which may be modified from time to
    time in BLP’s sole discretion. The Prepaid Fee, and all taxes and other
    fees related thereto will be paid by you in advance. In no event will you
    receive any portions of the Service or the Service as a whole if a Prepaid
    Fee is required unless BLP receives all fees and charges payable by you,
    including the Prepaid Fee.</p>

    <h4>6. Registration and Account Creation.</h4>

    of which must be accurate, truthful, and updated. You shall not: (i) select
    a username already used by another person; (ii) use a username in which
    another person has rights without such person's authorization; or (iii) use
    a username or password that BLP, in its sole discretion, deems offensive or
    inappropriate. BLP reserves the right to deny creation of your account
    based on BLP’s inability to verify the authenticity of your registration
    information. You shall be solely responsible for maintaining the
    confidentiality of your password. You shall immediately notify BLP by
    submitting <a onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/feedback">FEEDBACK</a>
    of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s)
    of your account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including
    loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password or credit card
    information. You are fully responsible for all usage and activity on your
    account, including, but not limited to, use of the account by any third

    terminated. Notwithstanding anything else herein, BLP reserves the right to
    pursue any and all claims against any user of your account. You agree to
    maintain only one account with the Service at any time and certify that you
    currently have no other account(s) with the Service.</p>

    that Bloomberg and its Suppliers, agents, directors, officers, employees,
    representatives, successors, and assigns shall have no responsibility or

    agents, directors, officers, employees, representatives, general partner,
    subsidiaries, successors, and assigns, or otherwise arising in connection
    with the Service and shall not be liable for any lost profits, losses,
    punitive, incidental or consequential damages, or any claim against
    Bloomberg by any other party; or (ii) any fault, inaccuracy, omission,
    delay, or any other failure in the Service caused by your computer
    equipment or arising from your use of the Service on such equipment. The
    content of other Web sites, services, goods, or advertisements that may be

    reliability or continued availability of the telephone lines, wireless
    services, communications media, and equipment you use to access the
    Service. You understand that Bloomberg and/or third-party contributors to
    the Service may choose at any time to inhibit or prohibit their content
    from being accessed under the TOS.</p>

    <p>(iii) You acknowledge that: (i) the Service is provided for information
    purposes only and is not intended for trading purposes; (ii) the Service
    may include certain information taken from stock exchanges and other
    sources from around the world; (iii) Bloomberg does not guarantee the
    sequence, accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the Service; (iv) the
    provision of certain parts of the Service is subject to the terms and
    conditions of other agreements to which Bloomberg is a party; (v) none of
    the information contained on this site constitutes a solicitation, offer,
    opinion, or recommendation by Bloomberg to buy or sell any security, or to
    provide legal, tax, accounting, or investment advice or services regarding
    the profitability or suitability of any security or investment; and (vi)
    the information provided on this site is not intended for use by, or
    distribution to, any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where
    such use or distribution would be contrary to law or regulation.
    Accordingly, anything to the contrary herein set forth notwithstanding,
    Bloomberg, its Suppliers, agents, directors, officers, employees,
    representatives, successors, and assigns shall not, directly or indirectly,
    be liable, in any way, to you or any other person for any: (a) inaccuracies
    or errors in or omissions from the Service including, but not limited to,
    quotes and financial data; (b) delays, errors, or interruptions in the
    transmission or delivery of the Service; or (c) loss or damage arising
    therefrom or occasioned thereby, or by any reason of nonperformance.</p>

    <p>(iv) UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE, SHALL
    BLOOMBERG, ITS SUPPLIERS, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES,
    REPRESENTATIVES, SUCCESSORS, OR ASSIGNS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DIRECT,
    INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY
    DAMAGES EVEN IF BLOOMBERG HAS BEEN ADVISED SPECIFICALLY OF THE POSSIBILITY
    OF SUCH DAMAGES, ARISING FROM USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE OR ANY
    LINKS OR ITEMS ON THE SERVICE OR ANY PROVISION OF THE TOS, SUCH AS, BUT NOT
    LIMITED TO, LOSS OF REVENUE OR ANTICIPATED PROFITS OR LOST BUSINESS.
    APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR
    INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL BLOOMBERG'S TOTAL
    LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN
    CONTRACT OR TORT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE) EXCEED THE

    of, the Service by you or someone using your computer (or account, where
    applicable); (vi) any misrepresentation or breach of representation or
    warranty made by you contained herein; or (vii) any breach of any covenant
    or agreement to be performed by you hereunder. You agree to pay any and all
    costs, damages, and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable
    attorneys' fees and costs awarded against or otherwise incurred by or in
    connection with or arising from any such claim, suit, action, or proceeding
    attributable to any such claim. Bloomberg reserves the right, at its own
    expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter
    otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully
    cooperate with Bloomberg in asserting any available defense. You
    acknowledge and agree to pay Bloomberg's reasonable attorneys’ fees
    incurred in connection with any and all lawsuits brought against you by

    conflicts-of-law principles thereof. You agree to submit to the personal
