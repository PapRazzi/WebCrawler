<b>Current Poly students:</b>
If you are a BS or MS student currently enrolled at Poly, and looking for 
a MS Thesis or Senior Project topic or simply interested in getting some 
research experience, feel free to contact me for an appointment. I 
have a number of research topics available, mostly in the areas
of web search, data compression, and distributed systems, and am always looking
for strong and highly motivated students to work on them.
Note however that most likely this would be an unpaid research experience,
as I am usually unable to provide any research assistantship position, at 
least in the beginning. Also, be advised that I expect a significant time
commitment on your side, plus a strong academic background and motivation.
If you are willing to invest the effort, participation in research activities
can be a very valuable preparation for the job market or graduate school.

<b>Prospective grad students:</b>
If you are not a student at Poly, but currently applying or planning to apply 
to our PhD program, please
only contact me if you are interested specifically in my research area and
plan to work in this area during your PhD studies. Since I already have a
fair number of PhD students, I am unlikely to accept you as my student
unless you have significant background in the area and/or an extremely
strong academic background. For general application questions, please read 
the guidelines for PhD admissions on our department web site, or contact the
Director of Graduate Studies at dgs@cis.poly.edu. If you are
a prospective MS student, then it is very unlikely that I would be able to
offer you financial support, so there is no use in contacting me before you 
have been admitted.

<li>
<b>Incoming/admitted grad students:</b>
If you are an MS or PhD student who has already been admitted to our graduate
program but without full financial support, please do not contact me or other 
faculty members to inquire about research assistantships before arriving on
campus. If you were admitted
with limited or no support, it means that we were unable to offer more support.
Feel free to talk to me about
possible research after you arrive on campus, but be aware that most likely
this would be an unpaid research experience at least for the first semester
or so.
<p>
<li>
<b>Internships and visits:</b>
If you are a student from another school looking for a paid summer internship,
please do not contact me directly. I sometimes do have summer visitors, but 
this is usually arranged through direct recommendations from colleagues.
The same also holds if you are interested in visiting to perform research say 
for an MS thesis (or Diplomarbeit) or internship requirement at your school: 
if you do not need financial support from me and there is a close match in 
research interests, then it might be possible to arrange something, but please
ask a faculty member to recommend you to me.
