<div class="post-content">
  <h2>Designing the mobile version of an existing app is about so much more than screen size.</h2>

	<p>The fundamental concept of the new Basecamp is this: a project on a single page. Projects resemble a nicely organized paper document with wide margins, familiar proportions and plenty of white-space. In a glance you can see what&#8217;s happened in the project, what&#8217;s left to be done, and any relevant files. You can almost imagine peeling the sheet off the screen and handing it to a co-worker to get them up to speed. It&#8217;s an iconic design.</p>


	<p>We knew that this design would be instrumental in making <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id599139477">Basecamp for iPhone</a> <i>feel</i> like Basecamp so it&#8217;s no surprise that we attempted a very literal reproduction in an early version of the app.</p>


<figure>
<img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/1176-post_sheet_compare.jpg" title="Basecamp project sheet" style="border: 1px solid #ccc">
</figure>

	<p>It&#8217;s all here: the clean, white sheet topped with the project&#8217;s name  followed by sections with snapshots of the latest Discussions, To-dos, Files, etc. A virtual clone in smaller package. We were pretty happy with this <i>mini-me</i> design for awhile, but the story doesn&#8217;t start here.</p>


<h2>From the beginning&hellip;</h2>

	<p>The very first design was inspired by the cards on Basecamp&#8217;s <i>Projects</i> screen.</p>


<figure>
<img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/1177-post-home-cards.jpg" alt="Project cards design" style="border: 1px solid #ccc">
</figure>

	<p>Predictably, each card showed the project&#8217;s name, description, people and a jumping-off point to each content section. Just like the thin strip under the header in Basecamp, each section counted how many of each <i>thing</i> was in the project (5 Discussions, 10 To-dos, etc.). This design also succeeded in <i>feeling</i> like Basecamp, but it wasn&#8217;t particularly useful.</p>


	<p>Page loads are precious on mobile, each one takes time and sips more data from the customer&#8217;s plan. Here, choosing a project revealed no content – just a glorified menu. It&#8217;s a poor value for your tap. This feeling that there should be some payoff of real content when entering a project led to the aforementioned <i>mini-me</i> design.</p>


<h2>Priority #1: Show me the latest news</h2>

	<p>It wasn&#8217;t until we began to focus the iPhone app experience that the deficiencies of that design became clear. The top priority for the Basecamp iPhone app is fast access to what&#8217;s happening in your projects. Haplessly browsing content sections looking for something that&#8217;s changed was no way to figure out what was going on.</p>


	<p>Basecamp&#8217;s Catch-up screen shows a summary of each day&#8217;s project activity and a by-the-minute stream of every action. Catch-up was what we wanted but the information isn&#8217;t well suited for mobile. The Progress screen seemed like a better fit – it&#8217;s ideal for quick check-ins on all your projects. The resulting design is something we call <i>Latest project updates</i>, basically Progress scoped to just one project.  You can scroll back through the entire history of a project just by swiping.</p>


<figure align="center">
<img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/1178-post-latest-updates.jpg" alt="Latest project updates" style="border: 1px solid #ccc">
</figure>

	<p>This was a big breakthrough but seeing everything that happened wasn&#8217;t always appropriate. Sometimes you just need to know what got done (that&#8217;s whole point of projects, right?). Because it was hard to scan the activity steam and pick-out only what was accomplished, we made introduced the <i>Completed to-dos</i> screen. There you can see – day-by-day – what was completed and who did it. It&#8217;s great for spotting bursts of activity (and lulls) and revealing who is really killing it on the project.</p>


<figure align="center">
<img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/1179-post-competed-todos.jpg" alt="Completed to-dos" style="border: 1px solid #ccc">
</figure>

<h2>Priority #2: Drilling deeper</h2>

	<p>The <i>mini-me</i> design also failed to satisfy the the other top priority of Basecamp for iPhone: digging deep into the contents of a project. Jumping to the Files section, for example, meant scrolling past an unpredictable amount of Discussions and To-dos hunting for the button. How far down was different on every project. We&#8217;d already found that <i>Latest project updates</i> and <i>Completed to-dos</i>  were better at showing you what was happening in your project so now we knew we could do a better job of helping you jump into the content when you want to dig deeper. Enter the project menu:</p>


<figure align="center">
<img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/1180-post-menu.jpg" alt="Project menu" style="border: 1px solid #ccc">
</figure>

	<p>Here you can easily switch between the two main views or jump right into the content sections. Two taps, no scrolling, and predictable locations that build muscle memory was a huge improvement.</p>


<h2>Looking through the lens</h2>

	<p>Our focus on clear priorities was applied with equal success to the main screen of the iPhone app. Early versions had no opinion about what was important offering equal access to projects and content sections. Iterations on the design that amounted to no more than rearranging the furniture should have been a big red flag.</p>


<figure>
<img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/1181-home-sketches.jpg" alt="Project menu concepts" style="border: 1px solid #ccc">
</figure>

	<p>It wasn&#8217;t until we made the decision that getting the latest news is more important than digging through content that we were able to find the version you see now:</p>


<figure align="center">
<img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/1182-home-final.jpg" alt="Project menu final" style="border: 1px solid #ccc">
</figure>

<h2>Opinions change</h2>

	<p>When designing the mobile version of an existing app it&#8217;s easy to think that all you have to do is optimize for small screens. Keep it familiar, on-brand, shrink the contents to fit and you&#8217;re done. But truly crafting your app for mobile means considering the difference in forces (not just the physical ones) and re-thinking the jobs your app is hired to do. Even the most opinionated designs might just require a change of opinion on mobile. For Basecamp that meant that we had to let go of the core design of the Project screen on iPhone because the priorities we established were better satisfied with something new.  I&#8217;m curious to hear from others who&#8217;ve been through this process. How did your design change going from desktop to device?</p>

  <p>It&#8217;s been over 8 months since <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3186-workplace-experiments-a-month-to-yourself">our workplace experiment last July</a>, when I got an entire month to buckle down and make an iPhone app. Last Friday, <a href="http://appstore.com/basecamp">Basecamp</a> landed in the App store.  It&#8217;s been a long journey of simulator runs, device testing, and app crashes, but I&#8217;m convinced that I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to ship an iPhone app at all without RubyMotion. 
<br /><img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/1165-rubymotion.jpg" /><br />
I&#8217;ve tried to jump into mobile development a few times over the past few years, and I got stuck every time.  I made a Android app in Eclipse, wrapped my head around Lua and Corona <span class="caps">SDK</span>, and tried to deal with Objective-C, Xcode, and Interface Builder.  Not only did I have to throw out my existing toolset and workflow to break into this world, I had to ramp up with new APIs, frameworks, and more.</p>


	<p>RubyMotion came at the perfect time: I wanted to make mobile apps, I didn&#8217;t have to throw out my existing workflow, and I could still write Ruby! Here&#8217;s what I learned about my experience with RubyMotion from the past few months.</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>I can&#8217;t imagine anything less interesting in business than maximizing shareholder value. Yet this is what public companies are pressured &#8211; if not legally required &#8211; to do. A lot of non-public companies follow the same path towards performance and results.</p>


	<p>To take it further, maximization <em>as a concept</em> just isn&#8217;t interesting to me. I don&#8217;t care about maximization. Not maximization of profit, revenue, people, reach, productivity, etc. Not interesting.</p>


	<p>I feel like this makes me an outcast in the business world. Part of the minority, the ones who simply &#8220;don&#8217;t get how it works&#8221;.</p>


	<p>I get how it works. I just don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;m not interested in squeezing something so tight that I get every last drop. I don&#8217;t want, need, or care about every last drop. Those last drops usually don&#8217;t taste as good anyway. My thirst is usually well quenched far before that final drop.</p>


	<p>Am I interested in increasing profits? Yes. Revenues? Yes? Being more productive? Yes. Making our products easier, faster, and more useful? Yes. Making our customers and employees happier? Yes, absolutely. Do I love iterating and improving? Yes sir.</p>


	<p>Do I want to make things better? All the time. But do I want to maximize &#8220;betterness&#8221;? No thanks.</p>


	<p>I don&#8217;t mind leaving some water in the cloth, some drips in the glass, some money on the table. I like knowing there&#8217;s headroom. And once in a while it&#8217;s a fun challenge to chip away at that headroom. But that&#8217;s not for maximization&#8217;s sake &#8211; it&#8217;s for curiosity&#8217;s sake. &#8220;Can we do it?&#8221; is a lot more interesting to me than &#8220;we must do it because that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re supposed to do.&#8221;</p>


	<p>Having fun, exploring ideas, creating, solving, building great things for you and your customers, being proud of your work, challenging yourself, learning, growing, building a self-sustaining company on your own schedule, adding something useful to the world, and working with great people &#8211; that&#8217;s what this is all about. Not maximization of a metric.</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>We are proud to announce the first iOS app developed completely in-house at 37signals: the official Basecamp app for iPhone.</p>


	<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id599139477">Get it now for free on the App Store</a>.</p>


<figure><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id599139477"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/1159-basecamp-app-phones.jpg" width="660" height="534" border="0" alt="Basecamp on mobile devices" /></a></figure>

	<p>Here&#8217;s what you can do with it:</p>


<ul>
<li>Check in on your projects from anywhere. Basecamp for iPhone shows you the latest news on each project.</li>
<li>Jump in on a discussion and post your thoughts.</li>
<li>View progress as team members complete to-dos and upload files.</li>
<li>Look up anything in a project. Refer to a document or make a decision no matter where you are.</li>
</ul>

	<p>We discovered it&#8217;s very important on the phone to make sharp priorities early in the design.</p>


	<p>Our top priority was fast access to news. You&#8217;ll find the app makes it addictive to check in and feel the pulse of your projects throughout the day. You can quickly bounce in and out of projects. Project screens on the phone show the latest news first rather than static project contents.</p>


	<p>Our second priority was to offer the full depth of Basecamp. After you dip into a project, you can go deeper and browse its contents. A menu offers all the project sections like Discussions, To-dos, Files, and Documents.</p>


	<p>Iterating on iOS is tricky. The medium isn&#8217;t as flexible as <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">CSS</span>. To cut this down we used a hybrid approach. The page stacking behavior and navigation menus are native, while the rest of the screens are web views.  <a href="http://popapp.in/">Prototyping on Paper</a> came in handy for evaluating native design ideas before committing to code.</p>


	<p>We also used some shiny new tech. The app is built in <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com/">RubyMotion</a>. We barely touched Xcode. Look forward to some posts from Nick for details on that.</p>


	<p>We&#8217;ve been using the app constantly since we first had a prototype in our hands. I&#8217;m thrilled to share it with you today. It&#8217;s available now for free in the App Store.</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>Our customers can be unexpectedly, hilariously great sometimes. It’s not at all uncommon for one of us on the support team to post something a customer said in <a href="http://campfirenow.com">Campfire</a>, because “this lady just made my day!” or “this guy was so funny and nice!”</p>


	<p>Now, we’re empowered to do right by our customers, so that’s part of it&#8212;we can all take care of billing issues or ID merges or whatever our users need without going to a manager. (Psst: there is no manager.) When we’re able to fix a problem within a few minutes or we prove to be real people rather than robots, that tends to pleasantly surprise people, and they react accordingly. Awesomeness begets awesomeness.</p>


<blockquote class="longform">Super speedy, plain and clear communication &#8211; didn&#8217;t feel like a call-centre experience &#8211; was quite obvious that Jim knew what he was talking about rather than just reading from a script. Got the exact answers and actions that I needed. Not used to this level of service &#8211; feel a bit dazed ;-)</blockquote>

	<p>But we don’t deserve all the credit. Our customers just tend to be savvy, and kind, and they consistently disprove the popular consensus that people on the Internet suck.</p>


<blockquote class="longform">No problem. Machines don&#8217;t mess up near as often as often as people. So odds are I just didn&#8217;t save it correctly. Thank you again for your time and trying to help.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="longform">Chase answered my question quickly and completely. He also threw in &#8220;have an awesome Tuesday&#8221; which is a mildly absurd thing thing to wish someone as it is usually weekends which are &#8220;awesome&#8221;. I&#8217;m gonna run with it though and try to make this day &#8220;awesome&#8221;. I already high-fived my dog. He seemed confused.</blockquote>

	<p>A surprising number of folks write back just to say thank you. They don’t have to&#8212;it’s our job to help. But it’s still nice to hear and gives us warm fuzzies.</p>


<blockquote class="longform">You know what Kristin, you just made my day &#8230; and restored my faith (a bit) in our species.</blockquote>

	<p>Sometimes they go beyond that, even. Out of gratitude or wackiness or whatever, they send us photos and videos of their pets, or <a href="http://leanneellington.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/youre-awesome.jpg">links to memes</a>.</p>


<blockquote class="longform">Thank you. I attached a flying unicorn to show my appreciation.</blockquote>

	<p>Some of our San Francisco customers know <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/writers/merissa">Merissa</a> is a huge Giants fan, and a few submitted support tickets to tell her they were excited for her during the 2012 World Series. People will sometimes write in just to say they love Basecamp, or to wish us happy holidays.</p>


<blockquote class="longform">Just want to say Merry Christmas guys &#8230; we&#8217;ve been using Basecamp for many years and continue to love the service. Keep up the good work and hope to be on your service for years to come. Here&#8217;s a big thank you. Thanks to the web-based nature of work I can stay in touch while getting some awesome snow on holiday in Niseko, Hokkaido, Japan!</blockquote>

	<p>Those of us in support are here because we genuinely enjoy helping&#8212;but you folks make it easy. Thanks!</p>
