                        <p>One of the best aspects of Vimeo is our friendly community. Participating in the community is completely optional but we think you'll find it worthwhile.
</p>
<p>
The best way to get started is to upload something you've created. Vimeo Members will see you're an interesting and creative individual just like them. You should also watch videos and give feedback. When you're perusing Vimeo and you encounter a video you like, leave a comment. Tell that person what you think, why you like the video, or even what you think might help make it better. You can also click the 'Like' button to show your appreciation. Not only does this give the owner of the clip a good feeling, but now they're also more likely to check out your videos in return. Then, if they comment on and 'Like' your clips, your videos will be brought to the attention of their contacts, which will help increase the amount of views and activity your clips receive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Follow people!</strong> If you see someone's videos you like, go ahead and follow them. That way you'll see what they upload as well as the videos they 'Like' on Vimeo. The more you interact, the more members of the community you'll meet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Get involved in the Community Forums.</strong> Try looking in the <a href="/forums/screening_room">Screening Room Forum</a> to see if there are any cool projects you can participate in. If you're new, <a href="/groups/weekendproject">Vimeo Weekend Projects</a> are a great way to start making videos and have fun with people from all over the world.
</p>
<p>
As long as you're respectful and explore the creative videos our members are making you can have a swell time on Vimeo. Explore and have fun!

                        <p>Anyone can make videos. All you need is a camera and a little inspiration. Take a look at videos on Vimeo to see what other people are creating. Some people shoot videos with their phone or a digital point and shoot camera, while others are professionals with lots of expensive gear. Regardless of your expertise level, there's no shortage of great videos on Vimeo to inspire you and we love any kind of video you create.</p>
<p>
If you're a beginner, you can start by enrolling at <a href="/videoschool">Vimeo Video School</a>. Don't worry, it's free! Vimeo Video School is a fun place for anyone to learn how to make better videos. We recommend starting at <a href="/videoschool/101">Video 101</a>, a fun, basic guide to making videos.</p>

<p>Once you're ready to jump in, try making a video of what's in your fridge and uploading that. If you're feeling slightly more jazzed, try editing a video using an editing program. Most computers come with some sort of basic editing software, and the more you practice editing video with it, the more rewarding it will be. Or you can use our free <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vimeo/id425194759?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4">iOS</a>, <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.vimeo.android.videoapp">Android</a>, or <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/apps/ff8dadc8-8efd-42c7-a0f4-de7a48dd186b">Windows Phone 7</a> apps to edit footage and upload videos right from your phone. 

To practice editing a video, try making a <a href="/fivebyfive">5 Vignettes</a> - 5, 5 second video clips put together to make a short video. As you become more familiar with editing, try to make videos that are similar to the ones you enjoy on Vimeo. You can also join different Groups and ask other users questions about how they make their videos.</p>

                        <p>Compressing a video reduces the file size. While it can take time to compress a video, it will result in a faster upload, and also a faster download for anyone you choose to share the original file with. We strongly recommend you compress your videos before uploading them to Vimeo. That way you'll be able to upload more videos!</p>

<p>Take a look at our <a href="/help/compression">Compression Guidelines</a> for the best advice on compressing your videos.</p>

Our encoders don't like <b>Apple ProRes</b> codecs. They're intense codecs that don't play nice with our machines.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>slower connections and large files will take longer, so please be patient</em>.</p>
<p>
After your video is finished uploading, it will go through a conversion process. You can monitor that process with a progress bar as well. While the video is converting you may leave that page and Vimeo will send you an email when it's finished. Pretty easy, right?</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p class="media">

                                <p>Around here we like to say <em>"it's Vimeo, plus more awesomeness."</em></p>

<p><a href="/plus"><strong>Vimeo Plus</strong></a> is an affordable way for you to take your Vimeo experience to the next level. It's everything you love about Vimeo, enhanced to give you more control and freedom for your videos.</p>

<p><strong>First and foremost, it's 10 times more space for your videos</strong> – that means 5GB per week with Vimeo Plus. The videos you upload will have priority conversion and your SD videos will be converted at higher quality. And you thought they looked good before!</p>

<p><strong>Vimeo Plus makes HD embedding a reality as well.</strong>
You get unlimited HD embed plays for free with your Plus account. Now your website will look slicker than ever, with streaming HD video in Vimeo's well-designed player.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of the embed player, customization is the name of the game with Vimeo Plus.</strong> 
You have a totally liberating amount of options for embedding your videos and customizing exactly how they appear on other sites. Control every aspect of the player, from what's shown at the beginning and end, to the player buttons, even down to which sites are allowed to embed your video.</p>

<p><strong>All of this in a completely Ad-Free environment.</strong> 
That's right. When you buy Plus you'll never see banner ads again, leaving you with the cleanest experience in online video sharing you can find anywhere. However, people who watch your videos that are not Plus members will continue to see ads. </p>

<p>We've worked hard to provide you with an impressive set of features at an affordable price. We know you'll love it. </p>

                        <p>From your video page click on the 'Settings' button under the video and then select the 'Embed' tab and customize the player as you like. There is a helpful sidebar that explains the different customization options:</p>
<p>
Vimeo Plus gives you complete control over every aspect of the embedded video player. When you make changes, you can save your settings as presets so you can use those settings again for other videos. Remember, the settings you choose will dictate how this video will appear when other users embed it.</p>

<p><strong>Intro:</strong> 
You have the choice to show or hide your portrait, title, and/or byline when the video first loads. You can also control whether other users who are embedding your videos can show or hide these elements, as well.</p>

<p><strong>Outro:</strong> 
When your video ends you can choose to display one of these elements:
 </p><ul class="styled"><li>Videos: display the latest 3 videos from your videos, likes, channels, groups, or albums.</li>
<li>These three videos: choose any 3 videos </li>
<li>Text: write your own outro text, with basic HTML allowed</li>
<li>A link: display a link to another site</li>
<li>Nothing: show a black screen at the end of your video</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Everything else:</strong> 
Use the settings to completely customize the embedded video player. Leaving everything checked will enable the standard player available to everyone, but as a Vimeo Plus member you can customize it to your liking. Remember, you can always preview your changes to make sure the player looks exactly the way you want it to.</p>                                                                                                                                                                            <p class="media">

                        <p>Yes, as a Plus member, you can hide your videos from Vimeo.com by going to the video page and clicking the 'Settings' button located under the video. From there, click the 'Privacy' tab and select 'Hide this video from Vimeo.com.' Don't forget to save your changes!</p>
<p>
This allows you to embed your video on outside websites, but have it hidden completely on Vimeo.com.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p class="media">

To set it up, go to any video settings page and click the 'Privacy' tab, then choose the 'Only on sites I choose' option under 'Where can this video be embedded?' Then add the domain names for the sites where you'd like your video to be embedded such as your website URL, Facebook.com or Twitter.com.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p class="media">

                        <p>Is PRO better than Plus?</p>

<p>PRO is different from Plus, but not necessarily better. PRO is specifically made for companies, businesses and some professionals who are interested in using Vimeo for business and commercial use. PRO is not an upgrade path from Plus. While PRO offers several features that are not available with Plus (like <a href="/help/faq/pro#portfolio">portfolios</a> and <a href="/help/faq/pro#review_page">review pages</a>), it limits bandwidth and Community involvement. It's up to you to compare and decide which service is best for you. If you are a business, or want to upload commercial content, then Vimeo PRO is what you need.</p>

<p>Vimeo Plus is intended for individuals who want more features than a Basic (free) account, however Vimeo Plus users may not upload videos that are commercial in nature, or that are intended to sell or promote a product or service.</p>                                                                                            <p class="media">

                        <p>As a Vimeo PRO member, your account and your videos are automatically hidden from Vimeo.com since PRO allows for commercial use. If you're interested in enabling the Community Pass, you have the option to show your videos on Vimeo.com. However, with the Community Pass your actions (videos, comments, messages) must strictly abide by the <a href="/guidelines">Guidelines of Vimeo.com</a>.</p>

<p> Any Plays on your videos that appear on Vimeo.com will not be counted against your 250,000 PRO Plays. Only embedded Plays count against your PRO Play quota.</p>

<p>A few rules to follow when a PRO account enables the Community Pass:</p>

<p>- You may not use the Community Pass to promote your company, products, or services. Your videos must be non-commercial and created by you - just because you have permission to upload a video, doesn't mean you created it.</p>

<p>- You may not use the private messaging or video/Group/Channel commenting systems to sell or promote your products or services to the Vimeo.com Community.</p>

<p>- You may not add commercial content to Vimeo.com.</p>

<p>The Community Pass is located in your Account Settings.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p class="media">

                        <p>As a Vimeo PRO member, you can use a custom domain name for your Portfolios (example: www.example.com). You can easily use a domain you already own, or purchase a domain name elsewhere, then follow these instructions. If you already own the domain name you want to use, just skip step number 1.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <i>Unfortunately the Vimeo staff will not be able to offer support for all the issues or problems that may occur when setting up a domain. We strongly suggest asking a friend who has done this before for help, or see if one of your fellow Vimeo members can give any advice here in our <a href="/forums/topic:40958">PRO Domain Forum</a>.</i></p>

<ol class="styled">
  <li>Purchase the domain name from a registrar such as GoDaddy, Me-Net, or Register.com. This can be done for about $10 per year.</li>

  <li>If you want your Portfolio to live on your top-level domain such as “http://example.com” then you will want to follow the registrar’s instructions to set the domain’s A-Record to <strong>74.113.233.155</strong></li>
<p><i>Learn more about A-Records <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_record#A">here</a></i>.</p>

<li>If you want your portfolio to live on a subdomain such as “http://videos.example.com” then you will need to add a CNAME Record pointing to <strong>vimeopro.com</strong>.</li>

<p><i>Learn more about CNAME records <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record">here</a>.</i></p>

<li>You may have to wait up to 72 hours for these changes to take effect on the whole Internets.</li>

<li>Go to your portfolio settings page and scroll down to the Portfolio URL section. Switch the URL field from Default to Custom and enter the domain you just linked. You can then test your domain by using the 'Test this Domain' button.</li>
<li>Press the Save Changes button.</li>

                        Yes, with Vimeo PRO you can upload videos that contain ads, however you'll need to integrate those ads into your video before uploading, using an editing software, as the Vimeo player doesn't support pre-roll, post-roll, or overlay ads. For pre-roll, post-roll, or overlay ad integration, you may use a third-party player.

                        <p>From your video page click on the 'Settings' button under the video and then select the 'Embed' tab and customize the player as you like. There is a helpful sidebar that explains the different customization options:</p>
<p>
Vimeo PRO gives you complete control over every aspect of the embedded video player. When you make changes, you can save your settings as presets so you can use those settings again for other videos. Remember, the settings you choose will dictate how this video will appear when other users embed it, as well.</p>

<p><strong>Intro:</strong> 
You have the choice to show or hide the Vimeo logo, your portrait, title, and/or byline when the video first loads. You can also control whether other users who are embedding your videos can show or hide these elements.</p>

<p><strong>Outro:</strong> 
When your video ends you can choose to display one of these elements:
 </p><ul class="styled"><li>Videos: display the latest 3 videos from your videos, likes, channels, groups, or albums.</li>
<li>These three videos: choose any 3 videos </li>
<li>Text: write your own outro text, with basic HTML allowed</li>
<li>A link: display a link to another site</li>
<li>Nothing: show a black screen at the end of your video</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Everything else:</strong> 
Use the settings to completely customize the embedded video player. Leaving everything checked will enable the standard player available to everyone, but as a Vimeo PRO member you can customize it to your liking. Remember, you can always preview your changes to make sure the player looks exactly the way you want it to.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p class="media">

                        <p>Yes, you can upload a custom logo to use in your PRO player. Your logo will only show up on videos embedded outside of Portfolios and Video Review Pages. We recommend using transparent 100×100 png files, but you can upload whatever you want.</p>
<p>To upload a logo, visit 'My Settings' and click the <a href="/settings/advanced">Advanced tab</a>. Scroll down to 'Player Logos' and click on the box with a + sign to upload a video. Don't forget to save changes.</p>
Next, head over to your video settings. In the 'Embed' tab, check the box next to "Use a custom logo" and click on the logo you want to use. Make sure it becomes highlighted with a blue box. Finally, click 'Save Changes.' <p></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <p class="media">

<p>You can really help us out by not storing your original source files on Vimeo. Remember, we convert all your uploaded files to industry standard, compatible formats that are often just as good as your source files, and those will always be available to download. If you do wish to store your source files, go to 'My Settings' under 'Me' in the top navigation menu, then to the 'Videos' tab. Check the box that says 'Keep my source video files.'</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p class="media">

                        <p>You may have noticed that our add-on packages are priced equally to our baseline Vimeo PRO offering. When you buy PRO, you are initially allotted 50GB of upload space per year and 250K of offsite or embed plays. Extra storage capacity or plays are priced similarly to our base offering because, to be very transparent, our base package is pretty much the lowest possible price we can offer without substantial revenue loss. </p>

<p>Additional packages allow us to make back incremental revenue that is lost when PRO members use up all their space and storage. The vast majority of PRO members will not reach their limits, which means it's possible for us to charge a lower price for everyone. When a PRO member does reach their account limits, the add-on packages help us keep Vimeo humming along as one of the most affordable video sharing platforms out there. In summary, we try very hard to give everyone the best deal possible, even if that means we don't make a lot from our heavy-use PRO members.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p class="media">

<p>Basic account users can upload 500 MB a week (with a max of 10 files per day). Plus users can upload 5 GB per week, and there is no per-day upload limit.</p>

<p>This quota resets weekly, and your personal reset day can be seen on the right side of the <a href="/upload">Upload Page</a>, along with how much space you have remaining this week. Videos that you upload remain on the site, so you can upload 500 MB of videos this week, and another 500 MB next week, and they'll all be there for the watchin'.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p class="media">

                        <p>Compressing a video reduces the file size. While it can take time to compress a video, it will result in a faster upload, and also a faster download for anyone you choose to share the original file with. We strongly recommend you compress your videos before uploading them to Vimeo. That way you'll be able to upload more videos!</p>

                        <strong>File storage is expensive!</strong>
<p>You can really help us out by not storing your original source files on Vimeo. Remember, we convert all your uploaded files to industry standard, compatible formats that are often just as good as your source files, and those will always be available to download.</p>

<p>If you have a Plus or PRO account and do choose to store your source files, they will be available for as long as you remain a Plus or PRO member, and for 30 days after your subscription expires.</p>

<p>If you have a Basic account, your original source files are stored for one week from the upload date, after which they are removed. After one week you will still be able to download the converted file (in MP4 format).</p>

<p>Plus and PRO users can opt in to having their original source files stored with no time restrictions. Go to 'Me' in the top navigation menu and click <a href="/settings">My Settings</a>, then go to the 'Videos' tab. Check the box that says 'Keep my source video files.'</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p class="media">

                        <p>We feel that it's important to allow users to download the original, uploaded video file, as long as the owner of the video allows it. We provide this feature so that you can see the video
exactly as the videomaker intended it to be seen. However, we also have to guard against over-use of this feature. By being cautious with our bandwidth costs, we will be able to provide the Vimeo you know and love for years to come; hopefully until your great-grandkids log on to watch your videos!</p>

<p>Each original video file on Vimeo can be downloaded a maximum of 100 times per day. Please note that users with Basic accounts can make their original source file available for up to one week from the upload date. After that time only the converted, MP4, version of the video will be downloadable. Plus users always have the ability to download their original source files and make them available for download, as long as they've opted into storing their original source files.</p>

<p>Just to be totally clear here, we're talking about the video file that you uploaded, which can be downloaded from the 'Download' button under your video. This restriction is not related to the streaming video you watch in the Vimeo player.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p class="media">

                        <p>First things first, make sure you uploaded an HD video. In order for your video to receive the HD treatment, it needs to be greater than 4:3 aspect ratio and at least 1280 pixels wide.</p>

<p>Vimeo allows Basic members to upload one HD video per week, so if you upload two HD videos within the same week, only the first will show in HD, the other will appear in SD.</p>

<p>If an unusual amount of time has passed, and the HD version is still not up, make sure you are following our <a href="/help/compression">Compression Guidelines</a> and try again.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p class="media">

                        <p>Some people call these poster frames or preview images, we call them thumbnails.</p>

<p>To change your thumbnail, go to the video's individual page and click on the "Settings" button that appears under the video. From there, scroll down to "Thumbnails."</p>
 
<p>To select a frame from your video, click the "Choose" button and then click "Use this frame" when you get to a frame you like. If you're having trouble selecting the exact frame you're after, try using our <a href="/help/faq/using_the_vimeo_website#switch_player">HTML5 player</a>. To upload a custom thumbnail, click on the "Upload" button and upload your image. We recommend uploading an image with the same resolution as your video. Then sit back and admire your new thumbnail, you're all done!</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p class="media">

                        <p>If you're trying to share your video on Facebook but it's appearing as password protected or otherwise unplayable, this issue is caused by Facebook storing the URL's information from the first time it was added to their system.</p>
<p>To fix this, follow these steps:
</p><ol class="styled"><li>From your video's page click the "Settings" button.</li>
<li>Select the "Advanced" tab and enter a custom URL.</li>
<li>Click the "Save Changes" button to do just that.</li>
<li>Paste your new custom URL into the Facebook share box.</li></ol>
<p></p>
<p>If your video still won't embed properly on Facebook, try using <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug">Facebook's link debugger</a>.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p class="media">

                        <p>We know stuttering is annoying, and there are many possible reasons why you may be experiencing poor video playback. Vimeo requires a better than average internet connection and computer processor, so if you have a slow connection or older computer, you may experience issues.</p> 
<p>If not, here are a few things you can try: </p>
<ol class="styled">
<li>Make sure you have the latest version of Flash running on your computer. You can check what version you have here: <a href="/help/flash">vimeo.com/help/flash</a>.</li>

<li>Please turn off any other programs, virus protection, ad block, or energy saving settings as they may interfere with video playback.</li>

<li>Try closing other browser tabs if you have many opened.</li>

<li>Try another browser and see if that helps.</li>
<li>If you have taken these steps and are still having issues with playback, you can help us out by reporting the video using our "Report Slow Loading" feature. Simply right click the video player after you hit Play and select the option, "Report Slow Loading". Please note that this feature is only available with the Flash player.</li>

<p><strong>Important!</strong> In general, videos with fast camera pans, quick zooms in and out, fast moving subjects (think nascar races) or sudden changes in light conditions do not compress well.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <p class="media">

                        <p>Kind of. We have a timestamp feature that allows you to link to different times in a video from the description. To timestamp a video, put the specific time of the video you would like to link to. For example, writing 2:32 in the description, will send a viewer to the 2 minute, 32 second mark after the video loads. You may add as many timestamps as you please.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p class="media">

                        <p>Plus users can make mobile versions of their videos two ways.</p>

<ol class="styled">

<li>Go to <a href="/settings/videos">My Settings</a> and select the "Videos" tab. From there check the box next to "Make my videos compatible with mobile devices" and click the "Save as default" button. Check "Also, apply to existing videos" to do just that.</li>

<li>If you own an iPhone, iPod Touch, or Android device, you can go to our mobile site (<a href="/m">vimeo.com/m</a>) and make mobile versions of your videos. After logging in, select "My Videos" then the "Generate Mobile Videos."'</li>

</ol>
<p></p>
<p>Once you choose to make mobile versions of your videos every new video you upload will get a mobile version and all of your existing videos will be queued up to be converted. Depending on the size of your collection, this could take some time to generate.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p class="media">

<p>We hope to have time to develop proper support for closed captioning soon.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p class="media">

                        <p>The idea underlying Creative Commons is that some people may not want to exercise all of the intellectual property rights the law affords them. We believe there is an unmet demand for an easy yet reliable way to tell the world “Some rights reserved” or even “No rights reserved.” Many people have long since concluded that all-out copyright doesn't help them gain the exposure and widespread distribution they want. Many entrepreneurs and artists prefer to rely on innovative business models rather than full-fledged copyright to secure a return on their creative investment. Still others get fulfillment from contributing to and participating in an intellectual commons.</p> 
<p>For whatever reasons, it is clear that many citizens of the Internet want to share their work — and the power to reuse, modify, and distribute their work — with others on generous terms. Creative Commons intends to help people express this preference for sharing by offering the world a set of licenses on our Website, at no charge.</p>

                                <p>We give users the option to apply Creative Commons licenses to their own videos.  While our Terms of Service prohibits users from uploading infringing content, we cannot guarantee that every user who uploads a video and applies a Creative Commons to it has all of the rights necessary to do so. </p>

<p>If the user does not possess all of the necessary rights in a video (or any content within the video), then the Creative Commons license will not be effective in regard to that content.  Therefore, we suggest you exercise caution in using Creative Commons-licensed materials.  You may want to send a private message to a user who has uploaded Creative Commons-licensed materials to learn more about the licensed content.</p>

<p>If you have reason to believe that a user has uploaded infringing content (e.g., a popular TV show or film), we encourage you to <a href="https://vimeo.com/help/faq/abuse#report">flag the video</a> so a Vimeo moderator can review it.</p>                                <p class="media">

                        <p>If you notice that some of the videos you uploaded are out of sync on Vimeo, it probably means that one or more of your compression settings are off. Here are the most common causes for a loss of audio sync:</p>

<ul class="styled">
<li>Your video is encoded with a <i>variable</i> frame rate. <b>Solution:</b> Re-encode your video with a <i>constant</i> frame rate.</li>
<li>Your video is encoded with a frame rate we don't support. <b>Solution:</b> Re-encode your video at 23.98, 24, 25, 29.97, or 30 fps.</li>
</ul>

<p>Read more about frame rate encoding settings in our <a href="/help/compression#video_frame_rate">Video Compression Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>If you followed all of our recommended <a href="/help/compression">Video Compression Settings</a> and your videos are still out of sync, contact us and we'd be happy to take a look. Before you do that, please take the following steps to figure out where the sync issue is occurring.</p>

<p>(1) Check your source file (the one you uploaded to Vimeo initially) and make sure it is in sync.
(2) Download the Vimeo-encoded HD and SD versions of your video. Watch both and make note of whether or not they are in sync.
(3) On the video page, switch between the Flash and HTML5 players on a compatible browser such as Google Chrome, and then refresh the page. Check to see if the video is out of sync in one, the other, or both versions of the player.</p>

<p>Once you've collected all of that information, <a href="https://vimeo.com/help/contact">contact us</a> with all of the details we asked about above, along with a link to the video(s) in question and description of the places in the video where the loss of sync is especially apparent.</p>                                                                                            <p class="media">

                        <p>Vimeo respects your videos and your right to decide who watches them. Privacy options allow you to upload videos and choose who can see them. To access the privacy settings of your video, click the "Settings" button under your video on the video page, then click the "Privacy" tab.</p>
<p>You can select from the following privacy options to determine who can see your video:</p>
<ul class="styled">
<li> <strong>Anyone</strong>  - Allow anyone to see this video.</li>
<li> <strong>Only me</strong> - Make this video visible to me and no one else</li>
<li> <strong>Only people I follow</strong> - Make my videos visible only to people I follow on Vimeo</li>
<li> <strong>Only people I choose</strong> - I'll select people with whom I want to share this video (Note: this setting will only work for sharing with other Vimeo members)</li>
<li> <strong>Only people with a password</strong> Protect this video with a password (Note: you can share password protected videos with non-Vimeo members)</li>
<li><strong>Hide this video from Vimeo.com (Plus + PRO only)</strong> - I want to post this video on the web but don't want it to be available on Vimeo.com. (This will hide your video on Vimeo.com and remove it from public Albums, Channels, and Groups.)</li></ul>

<p>You can select from the following privacy options for video embedding:</p>
<ul class="styled">
<li><strong>Anywhere</strong> - Enable people to embed this video on any site</li>
<li><strong>Nowhere</strong> - Do not allow anyone to embed this video
</li><li><strong>Only on sites I choose (Plus + PRO only)</strong> - I'll specify sites on which people can embed this video</li></ul>

<p>You can select from the following privacy options to determine who can comment on your video:</p>
<ul class="styled">
<li><strong>Anyone</strong> – Allow anyone to leave comments on this video</li>
<li><strong>No one</strong> – Do not allow anyone to comment on this video</li>
<li><strong>Only people I follow</strong> – I want only people I follow to be able to leave comments</li></ul>

<p>PRO members can also create <strong>Video Review Pages (PRO only)</strong> - semi-private, unlisted video pages intended for sharing with clients, collaborators, internal use, or anyone else you want to share your video with. These pages are unbranded and accept anonymous comments, so even people who don’t have Vimeo accounts can leave feedback. Video Review Pages are automatically created whenever you upload a video, and can be accessed via a link under the video on your video page and in the video settings under the "Privacy" tab.</p>                                                    <p class="media">

                        <p>Embedding allows you to take your video - or someone else's video - and post it on a web page outside of Vimeo. For example, you can embed a video on your blog and then people can watch your video there without having to visit Vimeo.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p class="media">

<p>
Vimeo Plus and PRO give you complete control over every aspect of the embedded video player. When you make changes, you can save your settings as presets so you can use those settings again for other videos. Remember, the settings you choose will dictate how this video will appear when other users embed it.</p>

<p><strong>Intro:</strong> 
You have the choice to show or hide your portrait, title, and/or byline when the video first loads. You can also control whether other users who are embedding your videos can show or hide these elements, as well.</p>

<p><strong>Outro:</strong> 
When your video ends you can choose to display one of these elements:
 </p><ul class="styled"><li>Videos: display the latest 3 videos from your videos, likes, channels, groups, or albums.</li>
<li>These three videos: choose any 3 videos </li>
<li>Text: write your own outro text, with basic HTML allowed</li>
<li>A link: display a link to another site</li>
<li>Nothing: show a black screen at the end of your video</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Everything else:</strong> 
Use the settings to completely customize the embedded video player. Leaving everything checked will enable the standard player available to everyone, but as a Vimeo Plus or PRO member you can customize it to your liking. Remember, you can always preview your changes to make sure the player looks exactly the way you want it to.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p class="media">

<p>To create an embed preset go to one of your videos and click the "Settings" button that appears below the video. From there, go to the "Embed" tab and once you've customized the embed settings to your liking click the "+ Create new preset from these settings" button. Name your new preset and click "Save preset." From now on you can apply this preset to any video by going to the video's settings, clicking the "Embed" tab and selecting the preset from the drop-down menu under "Presets."</p>
<p>To apply a preset to all your videos, go to your <a href="/settings/videos">Global Video Settings</a> and select your preset from the drop-down menu under "Choose embed preset to apply to your videos" then click the "Save as default" button. Check "Also, apply to existing videos" to do just that.

                        <p>This is the default image that Vimeo uses as your avatar or portrait. You can replace this with an image of yourself to give your presence on Vimeo more of your personality. </p>
<p>To add your portrait, simply click on the 'Settings' button from your profile, then select the 'Profile' tab. Click on the box with a + sign and select your image. You can upload several different portraits and choose one as your primary picture. If you'd like to delete a portrait simply hover over it and click on the red X  on the top left corner.

                        <p>Make sure you're running the most up-to-date version of your browser, and double check that your connection to the Internet is rock solid. Try not to have too much going on in other tabs or browsers, as long files tend to get hung up if there's too much other activity. If you're still experiencing issues, we recommend you use a hardwire ethernet connection and turn off wifi, and any virus protection, ad block, or energy saving settings!

</p><p>If those steps don't help, please make sure your video is exported according to our <a href="/help/compression">Compression Guidelines</a>. The closer you are to those settings, the more easily your source file will upload to Vimeo.</p>                                                                                            <p class="media">

                        <p>For a number of different reasons, video conversion may sometimes be temporarily backed up on Vimeo. When this happens, Vimeo developers immediately jump on the case to help speed up the process and the system usually catches up within a matter of hours.</p>

<p><b>In these situations, there is no need to replace or re-upload your file. Doing this will actually move your conversion request further back in the queue.</b></p>

<p>If you're a Plus a PRO member, your videos awaiting conversion will still be at the front of the line and among the first to be converted once the process catches up.

                        <p>Occasionally issues with black or blank frames being dropped or lost can crop up. This is because editing programs tend to drop the frame rate in clip portions that are black to 1FPS, which can then be interpreted as blank by the Vimeo system and cause sync issues. An easy fix is to insert a "slug" (also known as a black shape or image) to keep the frame rate normal in the editor, therefore keeping your videos and our machines happy!</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p class="media">

                        <p>Your video must be at least 200KB in size in order to upload to VImeo. This is because many people accidentally create "Reference movies" when trying to export from QuickTime and other video editing programs. Reference files don't contain any actual video, just links to the files. When exporting from QuickTime, always choose the "Save as self-contained" option.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p class="media">

Thanks to a feature that allows you to export and upload your video directly from the Share menu in iMovie, getting your video to Vimeo is a breeze. To learn more about this, head over to our in depth tutorial at the Vimeo Video School: <a href="/videoschool/lesson/39">vimeo.com/videoschool/lesson/39</a>.<p></p>

<p>You can select files from any Dropbox folder(s) you've given Vimeo access to. Select as many files and you wish and then click "I'm done choosing files." On the upload page, click the bright green "Upload Selected Videos" button to start your upload. Once you've uploaded your video you’ll need to keep the original file in the same place within your Dropbox.</p>

<p>If you move, delete, or alter the file by saving a new version or renaming it your upload may not go through. Once your video has uploaded successfully you can remove it from your Dropbox or make changes to the file, however your original source file will no longer be available for download. <a href="/help/faq/uploading_from_dropbox#download_original_file">Read more</a> about enabling downloads for videos uploaded from Dropbox.</p>

<p>Be careful when selecting your folder! If you choose a shared Dropbox folder as your auto-upload folder, anyone with access to that Dropbox folder will be able to add videos to your Vimeo account. To keep things simple, we recommend creating a folder called "Vimeo" somewhere in your Dropbox and using that.</p>                                                                                                                                                        <p class="media">

However, users will always have the option to download the encoded version(s) of your videos that appear on Vimeo.com if you enabled this option on your video's settings page.</p>

<p>If you want to re-enable downloading of your original file after you’ve modified the file on Dropbox, use Vimeo’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/help/faq/video#replace">replace feature</a> to replace the file that was originally uploaded from Dropbox with one uploaded directly to Vimeo.</p>

                        <p>Yes! It’s real, true, actual high definition. No tricks! Some other sites (we won’t name names) and even a few major media producers have been offering low resolution video as 'HD' just because it’s slightly higher than the quality typically seen on video sharing web sites, hoping you won’t notice. Don’t be fooled, Vimeo HD is true 1280×720, up to 30fps in MP4 media format.</p>                                                                                            <p class="media">

                        <p>Yes! To take advantage of HD, all you have to do is upload a clip that’s 1280×720 resolution or larger. Plus users can get 1080p quality by uploading a video with a resolution of 1920x1080. Our servers will make a standard quality version first, then a little later your clip will appear in HD.</p>

<p>Please note, if your video has an aspect ratio besides 16:9, your video will be scaled to a width of 1280 pixels.</p>                                                                                            <p class="media">

                        <p>Yes. Basic account members enjoy a weekly quota of 500MB and 1 HD video, so it’s a good idea to compress your video down from phenomenally high quality to just amazingly high quality. </p>

<p>We recommend using the H.264 codec at size 1280×720, bit rate 3000-5000 kbits/sec (optimized for 'download'), key frame every 30 frames (frame reordering on), using whatever frame rate you shot in. For sound, use AAC at 128kbps in stereo.</p>

                        <p>It's almost always a good idea. If you're outputting 1080i, deinterlace and resize to 1280×720 before you upload. In many cases if your final outcome is a progressive medium (web, HDTVs, Blu-Ray, etc.) you might be better off deinterlacing before you even start editing.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                <p class="media">

                        <p>Vimeo converts all HDV and AVCHD videos shot at 1440x1080 (aspect ratio 1.3333) to its correct and intended playback of 1280x720 (pixel aspect ratio 1.0000). What that means in English, is that 1440x1080 videos are shot in anamorphic (wide) standards instead of 16:9, and previously those videos would appear squished upon conversion to Vimeo. This change will affect anyone uploading their videos in letterbox 1440x1080, so we recommend not to letterbox videos at that aspect ratio.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p class="media">

                        <p>Absolutely.

                        <p>Vimeo allows Basic members to upload one HD video per week, so if you upload two HD videos within the same week, only the first will show in HD, the other will appear in SD. </p>

                        <p>The Vimeo API, or Application Programming Interface, is a way for developers to gain access to certain parts of the Vimeo website in order to create an application using data from Vimeo. The <a href="/api/docs/simple-api">Simple API</a> is a very simple interface to access lots of data from Vimeo. You can get data via JSON, XML, and serialized PHP. You do not need a Developer API Key to use the Simple API. </p>

<p>The <a href="/api/docs/advanced-api">Advanced API</a> is more complicated than the Simple API, but you can get a lot more data from it. You will need a Developer API Key to use the Advanced API. If you want to test out the Advanced API, head over to the Sandbox.</p>

If your problem doesn’t improve after multiple attempts, try holding down the shift button on your keyboard and pushing the reload button on your browser. This will reset the cache in your browser, which will often clear up any problems. If this method still doesn’t work, quit your browser and reopen it and try again. You may also try signing out of your Vimeo account and signing back in.

                        <p>We all love browser extensions, they can add much needed functionality and make our day more enjoyable and productive. However sometimes these <strong>extensions</strong> (also known as <strong>add-ons</strong>) can interfere with the way a website is designed to work. The Staff may ask you to temporarily disable extensions when troubleshooting, in case they're the cause of any issues. Take a look at the respective article below for instructions on how to do this in your browser.</p>

<p>Explore Channels to find videos curated around certain themes that might interest you. If you find Channels that look cool, follow them and those videos will show up in your feed whenever they're updated. Explore <a href="/channels">Channels</a>!</p>

<p>Groups are also a great place to explore videos. Groups are communities within Vimeo that you can join and share videos with. There are TONS of Groups on Vimeo and we encourage you to join Groups to meet new people and find the great videos people are creating for that Group. Joining a Group also means any video added to that group will show up in your feed so you can always see what gets added! Explore <a href="/groups">Groups</a>!</p>

<p>As soon as you find videos that you like, we encourage you to explore the rest of that users' videos to see if you want to follow them. Following someone automatically subscribes you to his or her videos and the videos he or she 'likes', which will show up in your feed.</p>

<p>The <a href="/home/activity">Activity</a> tab on your homepage is also another great way to discover videos that people are liking and commenting on right now. You can sort that activity by all users or just the people you follow, to see what everyone's watching and talking about.</p>

<p>We recommend exploring the site and you'll find even more great ways to discover new videos!</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <p class="media">

                        If you want to upload video or shoot video within the app, you'll need to give permission to access your Camera Roll. If you deny permission, you may lose any video you've shot using the app, and you won't be able to upload video from your Camera Roll. That would be sad! :(                                                                                                                                                                            <p class="media">

                        If you're on an older device or you're still using iOS 5, you'll be asked for permission to access your location. This is only required because location data is saved with the photos and videos you shoot.

                        If you record your video with 1080p, the file size will be pretty large. If you’re experiencing slow uploads from the app, we recommend uploading your video over WiFi and connecting your phone to its charger.                                                    <p class="media">

                        Some mobile browsers have a preference that allows you to load the desktop version of websites instead of the mobile version. If Vimeo detects that you're accessing the desktop version of our site, we will attempt to deliver the SD or HD version of your video instead of the mobile version. This means that the video may not play on your iOS, Android, or other mobile device. (Be aware that this is true whether you're trying to access a video on vimeo.com or one that has been embedded elsewhere.)<br><br>

To ensure that you can access the mobile versions of your videos, make sure your mobile browser's preferences are set to load the mobile versions of the websites you visit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p class="media">

Next, find the song you'd like to use from Music Store and click the purple Enhance With Track button that appears next to the Play button.</p>

<p>If the video is longer than the track, you can drag the dashed purple bar that appears directly below the video preview to select the portion of the video where you'd like the track to play.</p>

<p>If the track is longer than the video, you can drag the highlighted area that appears on the audio waveform to choose the portion of the track you'd like to use.</p>

<p>The volume faders allow you to control the volume levels for both channels. Once you're satisfied with your newly enhanced video, you can click the Enhance or Buy &amp; Enhance button to do just that!</p>

<p>If you need to purchase a license for the track, just follow the directions. The last step for enhancing your video is deciding whether you want to replace your existing video with your enhanced video or upload it as a whole new video. That's it, your video is now enhanced!</p>

                        <p> You can search for SmartSound tracks by clicking the Advanced Filters link that appears under the search bar and selecting SmartSound from the Provider drop-down menu.</p>

<p>SmartSound tracks will show a gear icon where you would normally see the song length, as well as a gear icon where you would see a shopping cart or download icon for other tracks. You can click the Play button to preview a track, and clicking on either of the gear icons will take you to the track page where you can customize it to your liking. With SmartSound, you can choose the arrangement or mood that suits your video, and track duration is customizable to your video. </p>

<p>To add a SmartSound track to your video, click the purple Enhance With Track button that appears next to the Play button. Then select the video you’d like to enhance under the My Videos sidebar on the right. The faders allow you to control the volume levels for both channels, and once you're satisfied with your newly enhanced video, click the Enhance or Buy &amp; Enhance button to do just that!</p>

<p>If you need to purchase a license for the track, just follow the directions. The last step for enhancing your video is deciding whether you want to replace your existing video with your newly enhanced video or upload it as a whole new video. That's it, your video is now enhanced!</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                <p class="media">

Finally, when you block someone, you automatically unfollow them and they automatically unfollow you (if applicable).

                        Sure. When trying to decide whether to follow someone, ask yourself this fundamental question: Do I want to watch this person’s videos? If so, follow them! And maybe leave them a message telling them what you think of their videos. Following is a way to bookmark the people you like on Vimeo, as well as a way to keep up to date on the videos they upload and enjoy. Keep in mind that not everyone you follow will follow you, and that following thousands of people does not mean thousands of people will suddenly start watching your videos.                                                                                                                                                        <p class="media">

                        Tip Jar allows your fans to show their appreciation for your videos with small cash payments to you. When Vimeo Plus or Vimeo PRO members activate it on a video, viewers will see a “Tip this video” button below the player on the clip page. They enter their tip amount and credit card information, and you get paid. Simple!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p class="media">

                        A tip is the ultimate expression of appreciation, and the easiest and best way to support the creators you love. With a tip, you're not only telling a creator how important their work is to you, you're also giving them the resources to make more of it. Whether we're viewers or creators, we're all members of the Vimeo community, and we can help it thrive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <p class="media">

                        <p>The first step is to activate Tip Jar by connecting your Vimeo account to a PayPal account.</p>

<p>If you’re a Vimeo Plus or Vimeo PRO member, you can activate Tip Jar on your <a href="/settings">Account Settings</a> or from any of your videos’ Advanced Settings. Scroll down to the Tip Jar section of the page and check the box next to “Activate Tip Jar.” You’ll be prompted to sign in to PayPal (or create a new PayPal account) and then connect your PayPal account to Vimeo. </p>

<p>Once you’re connected to PayPal, you can activate Tip Jar on individual videos in their Advanced Video Settings. Simply check the box next to “Activate Tip Jar” and then click “Save Changes.” Once Tip Jar is activated on a particular video, a “Tip this video” button will appear underneath the video player on Vimeo.com, allowing viewers to leave tips!</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                <p class="media">

<p>When the payment is processed, a statement reflecting the amount paid will be sent to the email address associated with your Vimeo account.</p>

<p>Along with <a href="/help/faq/tip_jar">Tip Jar</a>, our pay-to-view service provides creators with another way to showcase their work, connect directly with their audience, and get the resources they need for their next project.</p>

<p>The service is in a limited beta release for now, but we'll rolling out the feature to additional creators in 2013. Stay tuned!</p>                                <p class="media">

                        Content Ratings are a way to keep Vimeo accessible to as many audiences as possible. We ask creators to tell us if their videos contain nudity, violence, profanity, or illegal substances, and based on the categories they select — or don't select — one of the following badges will appear next to a video's title: <b>All Audiences</b>, <b>Mature</b>, or <b>Not Yet Rated</b>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p class="media">

If all of your videos can be categorized similarly, you can set a default rating for all your videos in your <a href="/settings/videos">Global Video Settings</a>.&nbsp;Under the heading "What is the content rating of your videos?" select the appropriate rating. Once you click Save as Default, the rating will be automatically applied to every new video you upload.&nbsp;Check the box next to "Apply to ALL my videos"&nbsp;if you want to apply the rating to all your videos currently on Vimeo.

                        Though often essential to artistic expression, so-called "mature content" can be decidedly less essential for certain audiences, such as children, office workers with their computer speakers turned up too loud, and people who’d rather not encounter particular things. Ratings give your viewers a heads up about what to expect from your videos, helping them make informed decisions and helping you avoid negative comments and complaints.                                                                                                                                                                                                <p class="media">

                        When you're watching videos on Vimeo.com, the rating of each video appears next to the video's title, right underneath the player. Depending on what category the creator chose (or didn't choose), you'll see one of the following badges: <b>All Audiences</b>, <b>Mature</b>, or <b>Not Yet Rated</b>.                                                                                                                                                        <p class="media">

                        We don't offer an option to filter out mature content at this time, but we're working on it. In the meantime, check the badge next to each video's title before you press play. If you're concerned about nudity, violence, profanity, or illegal substances, stick to the videos rated "All audiences."                                                                                                                                    <p class="media">

                        In the future, Vimeo will use these designations to help viewers decide which types of mature content they want to see and which they'd like to filter out. Giving your content a detailed and accurate rating now puts you ahead of the curve, ensuring that your videos will appear in all relevant search results.                                                                                                                <p class="media">

                        If a Vimeo moderator comes across a misrated video, we may change your rating and lock in the new rating. If we believe that you're intentionally misrating your videos to shock or confuse people, your account may be closed or restricted. But you'd never do that, right?                                                    <p class="media">
