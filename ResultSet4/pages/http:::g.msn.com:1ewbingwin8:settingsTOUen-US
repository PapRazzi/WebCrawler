Claims or disputes must be filed within one year.</span> To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute under this agreement must be filed within one year in small claims court (section 10.2), an arbitration proceeding (section 10.3), or in court, if section 10.9 permits the dispute to be filed in court instead of arbitration. The one-year period begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute first could be filed. If a claim or dispute isn't filed within one year, it's permanently barred.</p><p class="para"><span class="leadInPhrase_summary">10.9.	Severability.</span> If the class action waiver in section 10.4 is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then section 10 won't apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of this section 10 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder of section 10 remaining in full force and effect.</p></div></div><div class="section sectionNormal"><h2 class="title_section">11.
